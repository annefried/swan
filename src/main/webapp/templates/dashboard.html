            <div>SWAN is a web-based annotation system optimized for discourse annotation tasks:
                annotators can scroll through long documents, and tag sets with few labels
                are presented for quick and easy selection. For technical details and user manuals, check out our
                GitHub site (URL will be added upon publication).
