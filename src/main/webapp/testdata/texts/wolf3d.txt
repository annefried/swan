0.2 FOREWORD. 
 
Ok, It's been a couple of years now since the first release of this FAQ. 
Wolfenstein-3d has been out and available as shareware for over 3 years. 
Originally I wrote the FAQ to stem the very large number of posts and questions 
on Usenet's comp.sys.ibm.pc.games about this game. 
I must say that I think I've been successful in conserving some bandwidth by 
provision of this regular (most of the time) article.  
	This FAQ will be availible on the Games Domain WWW site  
(http://wcl-rs.bham.ac.uk /GamesDomain) and FTP site (wcl-rs.bham.ac.uk) and 
will be posted whenever I remember (about every month) to the Internet 
usegroups comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action and alt.games.apogee. 
 
 
I would like to thank all of the contributors to this FAQ. 
 
0.3 Id, APOGEE VS THE FAQ. 
 
Now hear this! 
Apogee and iD Software have nothing to do with this FAQ. 
They do not give me support with it (not counting some e-mail thanks from 
J. Wilbur at iD Software). 
This is NOT an official publication of either iD Software or Apogee. 
The information contained within this article is provided 'as is' as I collect 
it from various Usenet sources. 
I do make an effort to check whether the information is correct at the time of 
the post, but as usual no guarantees are provided. 
 
0.4 HOW CAN THE WOLFENSTEIN FAQ AUTHOR BE CONTACTED? 
 
I can be contacted via Internet e-mail at the following address:  
adam@scss.demon.co.uk. 
 
0.5 HOW CAN I OBTAIN THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE WOLFENSTEIN FAQ? 
 
1) Drop me an e-mail (--> See Section 0.4). 
OR  
2) Get it from the FTP site wcl-rs.bham.ac.uk. 
OR 
3) This article is also reposted about every month on  
comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action. 
OR 
4) Read it on the WWW site http://wcl-rs.bham.ac.uk /GamesDomain. 
 
0.6 WOLFENSTEIN & SOD RELATED FILES AVAILABILITY VIA FTP. 
 
Throughout this FAQ I'll be refering to some Wolfenstein related files. 
These can be obtained through Internet FTP archives. 
ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca [130.179.16.24] 
directory: 
/pub/wolf3d 
is the official wolf3d site. 
 
****** <<<<<< (will be referred to as 'MANITOBA' from now on) >>>>>> ****** 
 
I will not include any information on wolf3d related files unless they make 
their way to one of these sites. (Nope, wuarchive.wustl.edu won't do Sorry!) 
If you don't know how to get them there or don't want to do it yourself 
or don't have ftp access then send them to me. I'll be happy to upload them 
for you. 
 
 
1.0 THE WOLFENSTEIN NOVICE QUESTIONS. 
=============================================================================== 
 
1.1 WHAT ARE WOLFENSTEIN AND SPEAR OF DESTINY ? 
 
Wolfenstein-3D is a 3-dimensional action game from iD Software. 
(distributed as shareware by Apogee). Spear of Destiny is the commercial 
sequel of the same game that includes some enhanced graphics.

DIFFICULTY LEVELS: 4 
 
VIOLENCE RATING: PC-13 (profound carnage - analogous to the movies' PG-13) 
 
COMMENTS: Impacts visually. Highly addictive. Slighty violent. 
 
STORY LINE: In Wolf3D: Basically you're a WWII allied spy imprisoned in Germany 
		and you're trying to escape (full story included with the game). 
		In SoD: Capture the Spear of Destiny from a Nazi stronghold. 
 
AVAILABILITY: First part of Wolf3D is shareware. Extra parts can be ordered 
		  from the distributor (more later). For Spear there is a 2-level 
		  demo version and the full version can be obtained at your local 
		  software store. There are now SoD: Missions 2+3 availible as well. 
 
STAGES: Wolf3D: 6 episodes (parts) each containing 10 levels. 
		The shareware version only contains episode 1. 
		The registered version (pay $$) contains either 3 or 6 episodes. 
		Altogether there are 10, 30 & 60 levels in the shareware and 
		two registered versions. 
	SoD:    1 set with 21 levels of pulse-pounding action. 
		The demo version only contains the first 2 levels. 
		The registered version (pay $$) contains the full 21 levels. 
 
WARNING: Some people have reported being sick after playing or watching 
	 others play (a kind of motion sickness if you like). --> See 3.7 
 
1.2 WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO RUN WOLFENSTEIN? 
 
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: 
	 Processor: 80286 or better (Nope won't run on XT). 
	 Graphics:  256Kb VGA or better. 
	 Memory:    580Kb Conventional. Also supports EMS, XMS.

OPERATING SYSTEM & COMPRESSION UTILITY COMPATIBILITY 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
DOS        : 5.0, 6.0 (should be downward compatible to 3.3 but wasn't tested) 
Other OS's : OS/2, 
		 Windows: (Note if you've got a SB device driver 
			   installed under Windows or a Windows TSR 
			   like an hour chime running it may interfere 
			   with some of Wolfenstein's digitized sounds) 
			  Running WOLF3d/SoD under Windows isn't really recommended.

		 DR-DOS 6.0 
 
Compatible with: Stacker: Yes (2.0 & 3.0) 
		 Superstor: Yes 
		 DOS 6.0's Double Space: Yes 
 
1.3 WHERE CAN I GET WOLFENSTEIN FROM? 
 
You can ftp Wolf3D game from MANITOBA, locating it in /pub/wolf3d . 
It is archived as a PkWare's ZIP file (wolf3d14.zip). 
You can also ftp it from UWP. Look in /pub/msdos/games/id (file 1wolf14.zip). 
(Note: ziped with PkZip v2.04g) 
You must have PkWare's PkUnzip software to unzip the .zip file. 
(You can obtain the pkzip/unzip software from garbo.uwasa.fi /pc/arcers 
 filename = pkz204g.exe) 
The archive size is approximately 750Kb. 
There is an unpacking installation with this latest version (v1.4) of 
Wolfenstein so there should be no problem with getting started. 
 
You can also get a full version from Apogee (iD's Wolfenstein distributor). 
Info on ordering is included in the shareware version. 
Lately the full version has also been commercialised and should be available 
from local software stores and other retail outlets (such as K-mart). 
(This info is U.S only. Other countries may have had it available this way 
 for a long time now). 
 
You can ftp the demo of SoD from the same two sites (file soddemo2.zip). 
The archive size is approximately 740Kb. 
You can get a full version from FormGen (iD's Spear of Destiny distributor). 
Info on ordering is included in the demo version. SoD may also be obtained 
from your local software store. 
 
1.4 HOW DO I UNPACK SHAREWARE WOLFENSTEIN? 
 
You'll need PkWare's PkUnzip software (version 2.04g) to 'unzip' the file. 
Create a spare directory, then copy the file you've obtained into it. 
Next use pkunzip to unarchive the file. Like so: 
 
	pkunzip wolf3d14.zip 
	pkunzip soddemo2.zip 
 
(Assuming your pkunzip.exe is on DOS's command path.) 
 
1.5 HOW DO I INSTALL IT TO HD? 
 
Through unarching the program in 1.4 above, an INSTALLATION copy of the game 
was placed in the current directory. Just run INSTALL program supplied to 
install a runable copy on your HD. 
You can delete the INSTALLATION copy once a runable copy has been made 
(to save disk space of course). 
NOTE: Initially you'll need ~4Mb of HD space to unpack and install the game. 
For the SoD demo, unarching the program in 1.4 above will place a runable copy 
on your HD and you don't need to take any further installation steps. 
 
1.6 CAN I PLAY IT FROM FLOPPY DISK? 
 
You can play the shareware version of Wolf3D and the demo of SoD from floppy 
disk since it's only about 1.38/1.24Mb (we're talking 3.5" High Density disk 
here). You'll have to install it to a hard disk first and then copy it across 
to a floppy disk. 
The full registered versions of Wolfenstein and Spear are much too big for a 
1.44Mb floppy (unless you have something like a 20Mb floptical disk drive :) on 
which it would easily fit). 
The performance of the game running from a floppy is much the same except when 
you first load it up it takes it about a minute to load up all the graphics/map 
info, so just wait patiently. It's a bit slower between the levels as well. 
In the game itself there is usually no speed differential except in certain 
parts where it brings in a page of graphics for some wall panels. You can then 
notice a split second pause. 
 
1.7 WHAT'S WITH THE VERSION NUMBERS? 
 
The most current version of Wolfenstein 3D is 1.4. The newest version fixes all 
known bugs (as did 1.1 at the time, etc.) Apart from that there is not much of 
a difference unless it comes to map/graphics editors. --> See 1.8, 1.9 & 4.X 
A breakdown of the versions and what the differences are is below. 
(If you never played Wolfenstein this will sound meaningless, but then again 
 if you NEVER played Wolfenstein then where were you this past two years? ;) 
NOTE: There may have been some other bugs fixed between the versions which I 
	  don't know about, so if you think you know e-mail me. 
 
v1.0 - First release (05/05/92) 
v1.1 - Fixed some secret doors map bugs (on level 7 & 8 in episode 1 there 
	   were secret doors left out) and also some video problems (06/10/92) 
v1.2 - Secret level elevator bug was fixed (introduced in 1.1 :( ) (06/22/92) 
v1.3 - Was never released. 
v1.4 - Fixed something but I forgot what. It also changed slightly the graphic 
	   backdrop on the opening screen and other menus, changed the interior 
	   elevator graphic and added a calibration routine in the joystick setup 
	   menu. (12/03/92) 
 
The dates next to versions are the file stamp dates of the game .exe file. 
They are not the actual market release game dates. 
 
There were other 'internal' changes between versions but they are only relevant 
to mapping programs. --> See 4.X 
 
The version numbering of Spear seems to have gone through the same routine, 
but currently I only have info on the initial release: 
v1.0 - First release (09/28/92) 
v1.1 - No information available (yet? call on info) 
v1.2 - "	"  "	" "	" 
v1.3 - "	"  "	" "	" 
v1.4 - Final release, changes from previous versions unknown 
	   (01/05/93) 
 
1.8 ARE THERE MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS AVAILABLE, AND WHERE? 
	WHAT ARE THEY? AND WHICH FILES DO THEY CHANGE? 
 
Map/Graphics editors can be obtained from the same ftp site as the game. 
 
No, they are not written by iD or Apogee nor supported by them. 
(Also --> See Section 4.2) 
 
READ THIS! IMPORTANT!  READ! THIS! IMPORTANT!  READ! THIS! IMPORTANT! 
 **************************************************************************** 
 Apogee ask that you ONLY edit registered wolf3d. The latest level editors 
 will ONLY work on registered versions. Will FTP sites PLEASE withdraw levels 
 and graphics capable of running on shareware wolf3d. Anything that will work 
 on registered wolf3d/SoD, and ONLY registered, is OK. 
 **************************************************************************** 
Ok, continuing on... 
 
You can even share with the world your own map/graphics creations for 
Wolfenstein by uploading it to UWP in /pub/incoming/id . 
(--> See 1.9 for a complete list of iD's directories for that site.) 
 
NOTE:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
You are strictly not allowed to distribute the executable files from the 
registered full version of the game, i.e. any .exe files. 
Nor anything from the game for $ unless selling the game to third party 
(Legitimate registration transfer). 
 
The editors have been obtained by reverse engineering the map/graphics files 
and producing programs that changed those files in a manner consistent with the 
game requirements of them. 
 
The editor archives are: 
maped41.zip        map viewer/editor 
maped42.zip        "   "      " 
maped6.zip     "   "      " 
wolfed21.zip       graphics viewer/editor 
wolfm160.arj       map viewer/editor version convertor 
 maped8.zip         map viewer/editor 
 
The last one will let you convert between different versions of Wolfenstein 
since the map encryption for 1.0 is not compatible with 1.1 and upwards 
(and you may feel left out if you designed maps before with 1.0 and now have 
 1.1 or 1.4, etc. Not so! 
 BTW: 1.1 through to 1.4 are map/graphics compatible as known to date.) 
 
Also maped41[42][6]/wolfm160 will automatically detect what version of 
Wolfenstein you have installed so you need not worry if you don't want to 
convert maps (upgrade/downgrade (!) them). 
 
All of these files include ample docs with them, if you already have them and 
want some tips or help on their differences and shortcomings, then --> See 4.X 
 
In order to make the Map editors work for Spear of Destiny, an enhanced version 
of the .DEF files must be used. They should be obtainable in the same ftp sites 
as the map editors (file wmapdefs.zip and others). If you can't find them, some 
minor work will need to be done. Find the wall types (MAPDATA.DEF) and the 
object types (OBJDATA.DEF) that are undefined and define them in your *.DEF 
files. 
 
The aforementioned editors change the following files: 
 
Map editors: 
MAPHEAD.XXX 
MAPTEMP.XXX 
GAMEMAPS.XXX 
where XXX is either .WL1 for the shareware version or .WL3 and .WL6 for the 
registered 3/6 episode versions respectively. 
Note that GAMEMAPS.XXX replaced MAPTEMP.XXX in versions of Wolfenstein 1.1 and 
higher, i.e. MAPTEMP.XXX is only present in v1.0. It doesn't really make any 
difference since the map editors will recognize that. 
For Spear, XXX is either .SDM for the demo version or .SOD for the full 
version. To have some of the map editors work with them, you'll need to rename 
them to .WL6 files and then back to play the game. 
Please consult Section 4.1 to see if the map editor you're using will recognize 
SoD .SDM & .SOD file extensions. 
 
Graphics editors: 
VSWAP.XXX 
where XXX is as before. 
 
 My own word (Adam) on level editors: 
 
 Basically, GET ONE NOW! They are very, very good. I use mapedit 8.0. I have 
 a regular conversation going with Warren Buss, one of the writers, and 8.1 
 is done, but not on general release. They are adding Corridor 7 support, and 
 it will be released with a higher no than 8.1 when this is done. Mapedit 8.0 
 supports every single object in wolf3d, and has many useful features. It 
 also supports SoD and Blake Stone 3D. Before anyone asks, there are NO plans 
 for Rise Of The Triad support - it is too different. Also, levels are very 
 easy to knock up quickly, but don't. It is not as bad as Doom (2 months 
 per level!), but try and think about it. Get the player lost. Build in 
 traps. 
	Graphics editing is very fun, but you need to be a reasonably talented 
 computer artist, prepared to work for a long time to achieve results. Enemys 
 have 20+ frames of animation, and these all need to be changed. I am working 
 on a major add-on, Warhammer Wolfenstein, which is being done with two 
 friends - they work on graphics, I do levels. We will have something decent 
 out by february 95. 
 
1.9 ARE THERE DIFFERENT SETS OF READY MADE MAPS/GRAPHICS FILES, AND WHERE? 
 
If you are looking for an alternative set of map or graphic files for your 
Wolfenstein game then the sites mentioned in Section 0.7 carry them as well 
in the same or sibling directories. 
MANITOBA has the add-on maps/graphics/editors, etc. in the same directory as 
the game i.e. /pub/wolf3d . 
Make sure you look through an index file (normally 00index* or README to see 
what is what or --> See 5.1 & 5.2 for a short tour) 
At UWP have a look at /pub/msdos/games/id/home-brew directories. 
 
1.10 HOW CAN I CHEAT IN WOLFENSTEIN? 
 
There is a document on ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca in /pub/wolf3d called wolfdbug.txt 
that describes the various cheat options in Wolfenstein and how to access them. 
I have reproduced it here with some updates. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
THE WOLFENSTEIN 3-D DEBUG MODE FILE 
 
(v1.0 means Wolf3D version 1.0 and v1.1 means Wolf3D version 1.1. 
Cheating with other versions is equivalent to v1.1 except as noted.) 
 
To enter the mode, do the following: 
 
1.  Invoke Wolfenstein 3-D with the "next" parameter (wolf3d -next) 
	for v1.0, or the "goobers" parameter for v1.1.  You can also use 
	whatever other command-line parameters you want. 
 
2.  Begin or restore a game.  While in the game, hold down the TAB, 
	CONTROL, and ENTER keys simultaneously for v1.0, or the LEFT SHIFT, 
	ALT, and BACKSPACE keys for v1.1.  You should get a message stating 
	that debugging keys are now available. 
 
That's it! 
 
To use debugging mode commands, hold down the TAB key and one of the 
letter keys listed below simultaneously: 
 
B   Changes the screen border color.  Don't ask me why it's here, but 
	it's here. 
 
C   Displays the number of statics, doors, and actors in the level. 
	Statics are things like food, ammo, pools of blood, etc., and actors 
	are the bad guys.  Doors should be self-explanatory. 
 
E   Moves you ahead two levels.  That's right, not one level, but two. 
	Unlike the W command (see below), this also takes you to the "level 
	completed" screen and gives you percentages, bonuses, etc. 
	In Wolf3D v1.4 and SoD, it moves ahead just one level. If you have 
	also used the "-tedlevel" parameter (see below), this command exits 
	the game. 
 
F   Displays your current position on the level (X,Y) and orientation (A). 
	To convert the X and Y values to coordinates that can be used in 
	Mapedit, divide them by 65,536 and round down.  A is in degrees 
	ranging counterclockwise from right.  ("Right" refers to the top 
	view as seen in Mapedit.) 
 
G   Turns what iD calls "GOD mode" on and off.  Basically it just means 
	that you're invincible.  The screen still turns red when you would 
	normally be hurt, though.  This can get very annoying if you want to 
	do something fun like kill the episode's boss with your knife. 
 
H   Hurts you (-16% health).  Not much use to us, but I guess iD had to 
	debug their damage code just like everything else. 
 
I   "Free items."  Ups your health, ammo, and score, and gives you the 
	next most powerful weapon.  (Machine gun if you didn't have it, 
	Gatling gun if you did.) 
 
M   Displays memory usage.  Loads of fun. 
 
N   Turns "No clipping" on or off.  This lets you walk through walls. 
	Wall-walking does STRANGE things to the graphics (try approaching a 
	door from the side and opening it).  It also does strange things 
	to the bad guys.  If you walk into a room through the wall, often 
	they won't notice you at all, even if you walk right in front of 
	them or fire your machine gun (in some direction besides at them, 
	of course).  This command is not available in the registered version 
	of Wolf3D nor in shareware versions other than v1.0 but it is in SoD. 
	(I guess we should be glad that ANY of the commands are available.) 
 
O   Changes the main viewscreen to a map of the current level, which 
	you can scroll through using the movement keys or the mouse.  It's 
	neat, but I wish that it weren't so ugly.  Those numbers are from 
	the internal level format.  ESC will get you out.  Unfortunately 
	this command doesn't work in v1.1 nor in SoD. 
 
P   Pauses the game, without putting up the little "Paused" window. 
	I guess this makes it nice for taking a screen shot, although in 
	v1.1 it changes the screen border to an ugly bright white. 
 
Q   Bombs the machine in v1.0.  Exits the game in v1.1.  Both of these 
	functions are about equally useless. 
 
S   Turns slow motion on or off.  If you have a slow computer you don't 
	need this. 
 
T   Pops up a window which displays graphics and sounds from the game. 
	Use the left and right arrow keys to page through the entries. 
	If you come to a blank entry, keep going.  You'll know when you've 
	reached the end (500-something) because you won't be able to go 
	any higher.  ESC exits.  v1.1 has some interesting graphics that 
	v1.0 lacks, including two sprites which are particularly intriguing. 
	Don't bother calling Apogee and making yourself look like a fool 
	only to be told that you didn't win anything; I already did. 
	(You'll understand what I mean when you've seen the sprite.) 
 
V   Asks you how many extra VBLs you want.  High values seem to make 
	the game sluggish and not much else. 
 
W   Warps to any level.  Although it prompts for a value from 1 to 10, 
	you can actually enter any number up to 20 in the registered 
	version.  Eleven through twenty correspond to levels one through 
	ten in the episode following the one you're currently playing. 
	In SoD, it prompts for a value from 1 to 21. 
 
X   "Extra stuff."  Doesn't appear to do anything.  If you can amend 
	this, let me know. 
 
Miscellaneous notes: 
 
TEDLEVEL - You can use the "-tedlevel" command-line parameter to quickly 
start Wolf3D and warp to any level.  The parameter is followed by a 
two-digit number.  The tens digit is the episode number minus one, and 
the ones digit is the level number minus one.  For example, to go to 
level 10 of episode three, type: 
	wolf3d -tedlevel 29 
and to go to the first episode, level 2, type: 
	wolf3d -tedlevel 1 
By default, you will play the level on the "Don't hurt me" difficulty 
setting.  To change this, use one of the command-line parameters "-baby" 
"-easy" "-normal" "-hard".  They stand for the obvious difficulties. 
Using the "-tedlevel" parameter also gives you an infinite number of 
lives.  Combine it with "-goobers" (or "-next") for even more fun. 
 
DEMO RECORDING MODE - This "debugging" feature is not accessed in the 
same way as the other commands, and it is available only in v1.0.  To 
record a demo, follow step one from the beginning of this file, and 
then hold down TAB at the title screen (the one with B.J. hiding from 
a guard).  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way to display 
these demos after they've been recorded, but if you've ever had a 
secret desire to play Wolfenstein 3-D with a big "DEMO" sign at the 
 top of the screen, this is how to do it. Theory: I do not have 1.0 of 
 wolf3d - i use 1.1 - but I think that if you leave it on the title screen 
 long enough, you get a demo, and this is probably what you are recording. 
 
SPEAR OF DESTINY - SoD's debugging mode is quite similar to Wolf3D's. 
Just use the command-line parameter "-debugmode" and the same key combo 
as v1.1. Oh, and be sure to check out what happens to B.J. when you turn 
on God mode...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 and then there's always the LIM cheat. 
 
What you do is press L, I and M all together and you get full health & ammo as 
well as the chain gun and both keys ;) However, it will reset your score to 0! 
 (This also renders the tab-I cheat useless). 
 
The equivalent of this cheat for the Mac (I think...the sender did not name 
system) is typing in BURGER. 
 
IMPORTANT: It seems that in later registered versions of v1.4 of Wolf3d the 
cheat mode has been disabled (appearently Apogee requested it). 
At the moment I have no additional info to differentiate these two versions 
of v1.4. If you have any such details (like file dates etc.) drop me a line. 
 
Apogee has also stated that starting with release of their game 'Biomenace' 
all their subsequent shareware game releases will be devoid of any in-built 
cheat codes. This is apparently to encourage registering the game (where 
the registered versions would have some kind of cheat mode (???) etc.) 
 
  
 
1.11 HOW CAN I CONTACT iD Software or Apogee? 
 
If you have some difficulties with Wolfenstein or Spear that are unresolved 
after reading this FAQ you can send e-mail to help@iDsoftware.com or 
apogee@delphi.com. 
Note that this FAQ is not produced or in any way sponsored by iD Software or 
Apogee, so they are not responsible for the material included herein. 
I would discourage asking them about the add-on products for Wolfenstein. 
Mail only if you have a setup, installation or hardware conflict, etc. 
 
1.12 I THINK I FOUND AN ERROR IN THE FAQ. 
 
If you find some information contained within this article incorrect 
I'll appreciate you informing me of it ASAP. 
 
1.13 IS WOLFENSTEIN AVAILABLE ON ANY OTHER PLATFORM THAN AN IBM COMPATIBLE? 
 
There is a SNES version (blood changed to sweat, dogs changed to rats) and 
a Jaguar (uncensored, slightly altered graphics) version. Mac version IS now 
availible, and uses the Jaguar graphics. The Archimedes version has just 
come out. No info on graphics. 
 
1.14 WHERE CAN I FIND VERSION X.Y OF WOLFENSTEIN? 
 
If you're looking for older versions of shareware Wolfenstein then MANITOBA is 
the place. 
These are the files: 
 
v1.0 - 1wolf3d.zip 
v1.4 - wolf3d14.zip 
 
If you want v1.1 (god knows why) you'll have to patch v1.0 using w3dpatch.zip 
(--> See Section 5.3) 
I don't know where to get shareware patch for v1.2 but the only difference 
from 1.1 to 1.2 was the secret level bug fix on episode 1 level 1. 
If you have an editor you can patch it yourself. But really, you should only 
need v1.0 (for some add-ons) and v1.4 (for the rest). 
 
1.15 WHERE DID iD GET THE INSPIRATION FOR WOLFENSTEIN? 
 
The The idea for Wolfenstein came from an old Apple ][ game called Castle 
Wolfenstein that the iD games liked. They had come up with the idea of the 
3D, texture-mapped, smoothly scrolling engine, and needed a game to use it 
with. Castle Wolfenstein seemed ideal. They couldn't think of a better name, 
so their legal guys went out and got the copyright on the name, and 
Wolfenstein 3D was born!

2.16 HOW MANY SHOTS DO ALL THOSE ENEMIES TAKE TO KILL? 
 
Here is detailed roughly how many shots each normal enemy takes to kill. 
 
1. Dog 
1 shot, 1 knife hit. 
 
2. Brown Guard 
1 shot if close up and on target, or hit in back, and 2 if at a distance. 
If your aim is out it can be 3. About 2/3 knife hits. 
 
3. SS Man 
About 8 shots or 12 knife hits. 
 
4. Officer 
About 4 shots or 6 knife hits. 
 
5. Mutant 
About 8 shots or twelve knife hits. 
 
6. Hitler's Ghost 
About 6 shots or 10 knife hits. 
 
2.17 WHAT WEAPONS DO ALL THOSE ENEMIES CARRY? 
 
1. Dog 
Bite 
 
2. Brown Guard 
Pistol 
 
3. SS Man 
Machine gun (you get it if you kill him) 
 
4. Officer 
Pistol (does more damage and fires more rapidly than the guard's) 
 
5. Mutant 
Pistol (Faster than officer's) 
 
6. Hitler's Ghost 
Fireballs 
 
7. Hans Grosse 
Two chainguns 
 
8. Dr Schabbs 
Syringes 
 
9. Hitler

10. Otto Giftmacher 
Can't remember (fill me in someone) 
 
11. Gretel Grosse 
Two chainguns 
 
12. General Fettgesicht 
Two chainguns and rocket launcher 
 
2.2 WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DIFFICULTY LEVELS OF THE GAME? 
 
There are four main differences: 
1) There are more guards on harder difficulty levels. 
2) They are harder to kill (can take more shots and you have to aim better) 
   on harder difficulty levels. 
   NOTE: on the lowest level 'Can I play Daddy?' you can generally pick off a 
	 guard even at long distance with one shot in the general direction 
	 (well, not every time but often). On the hardest level this usually 
	 will not happen. 
3) On harder levels you take more damage when shot. 
4) NB: There are a certain number of guards on difficulty 1 (can I play 
 daddy), the same on difficulty 2 (don't hurt me), they just do more harm, 
 more on difficulty level 3 (bring 'em on) and a hell of a lot on difficulty 
 level 4 (I am death incarnate! meaning: I am death personified, made into 
 a person). 
 
There is another minor difference. On the lowest level the 'first-aid kit' 
sometimes bumps up your health more than on other harder levels. 
--> See 2.8 & 2.15 for more. 
 
2.3 WHAT ARE THE SECRET ROOMS/DOORS IN THE GAME? HOW CAN I FIND ONE? 
 
The secret rooms are like any other room in Wolfenstein except they are 
accessed by a 'secret passage' (not really a door). There are certain wall 
panels which can be pushed (acted on) like a normal door. The wall will then 
slide back revealing a passage to another room. Secret rooms are usually used 
to store treasure, food, first aid and ammo packs and more powerful guns, i.e. 
the items of interest when survival is at stake (the treasure helps get more 
points which accumulate to extra lives, etc.). Sometimes they are used to store 
keys to locked doors, but not often (not in the Wolf3D shareware episode 
anyway). 
 
 NOTE: There is nowhere in the game that anything vital to completion is 
 hidden behind a secret wall. Keys are just to shortcut routes. iD thought 
 necessary secret rooms would be too hard to find. This is strictly untrue, 
 but the areas it is used (Episode 1, level 8 for example) are in tiny rooms 
 where it is dead easy to find the pushwall. 
 
Although there are no strict guidelines to where a secret room might be, you 
can get some slight hints on where one might be positioned. Since the maps in 
Wolfenstein are true (i.e. they're not warped space) then if you see a block 
of wall which is pretty thick and houses no standard rooms (operated by normal 
sliding doors) it could potentially house a secret room. Try first the obvious 
places on the walls e.g. Hitler's painting, nazi banner & other obvious wall 
decorations. Some secret panels are in the corners of a room, others in the 
middle of a wall (midpoint of a wall in a standard room). There are also a few 
between two objects, like between two plants or two barrels positioned against 
the walls. --> See 3.10 for more. 
 
2.4 WHAT ARE SECRET LEVELS IN WOLFENSTEIN? HOW CAN I FIND ONE? 
 
The secret levels are just another level which has been made a bit harder to 
find than others. To get to a secret level you must take a special elevator 
(well, they don't look special though, in fact in appearance they look like a 
normal elevator) from one of the normal (non-secret levels). Elevators like 
that are hidden. There's one secret level per episode (so there's one in the 
shareware version too :). 
When you arrive at a secret level it will be marked 'level 10' on your status 
bar. In Spear there are two secret levels in total, marked 19 and 20. 
After you finish the secret level the exit elevator will take you back to the 
level that you should have gone were it not for the secret level. Say you got 
to secret level from level 1, then after secret level (10) you'll end up on 
level 2. 
For a bit of a spoiler --> See 3.11 
 
2.5 WHAT IS THAT FUNNY OBJECT/SPRITE IN THE GAME? 
 
That funny object only occurs in the registered 3 or 6 episode version of the 
game. It is a sign saying to call Apogee. See, it was going to be a part of a 
competition with the game, like you find it and then call the distributor 
(Apogee it was then) and you could win something (???). 
The competition idea was dropped fairly quickly though, after all the mappers 
and editors were unleashed only weeks after the game's release. OK, for all 
those who haven't found it, the object is a wall saying "Phone Apogee Say 
Aardwolf." It isn't very exciting, trust me. 
 
2.6 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE CODES LISTED AT THE END OF GAME STATS? 
 
Same thing as in 2.5 the code is the checksum for your score in game. It was 
going to be a proof that you actually went through the game and obtain such and 
such score. 
NOTE: To my knowledge the codes only occur in Wolfenstein v1.0 & 1.1 
	  (maybe 1.2, not sure) 
 
2.7 ARE THERE GHOSTS IN WOLFENSTEIN? IF SO WHERE? CAN I KILL THEM? 
 
There are two kinds of ghosts in Wolfenstein. The Hitler's ghosts which haunt 
you in episode 3 level 9 (the boss level where you kill Hitler). You can 
certainly kill those. 
There are also some funny Pacman Ghosts in episode 3 level 10 (secret level). 
You can't kill those but they can hurt you if you touch them. Just stay clear 
and you'll be ok. (Or cheat with GOD MODE --> See 1.10) 
In Spear there are ghosts in the final floor (21). These white ghosts can be 
shot, but after a short while they reappear. They can also hurt you if you 
touch them. 
 
2.8 WHAT DO OTHER OBJECTS APART FROM AMMO, FOOD ETC. DO? 
 
Umm, well ... nothing really. They're there 'cause they look nice. 
 
Here's a short list of all the usable objects: 
Ammo clip: gives you ammo (duh) 
Ammo box (SoD only): gives you loads of ammo :) 
Machine guns (Schmeisser (some people call it PM-40) & Gatling gun): increase 
 your firepower. NOTE: They do not actually take more powerful bullets, but 
 the machine gun has rapid-fire and the chain-gun has 2 bullets at a time 
 rapid-fire. Two bullets from a pistol will kill a guard, so will two from 
 a pistol - it is just easier to fire from a chain-gun. 
Chicken meal, Dog food, Blood pool, Bloody skeleton & First aid kit: 
extra health 
Cross, Chalice, Treasure chest, Crown: points 
Sphere with your face on it: extra life + health + ammo 
 
Doors: open and close these. 
Keys: access locked doors. 
Elevator: use it to progress to next level. 
 
2.9 I'VE HEARD YOU CAN DRINK BLOOD IN WOLFENSTEIN? IS THAT TRUE? HOW? 
 
You can slurp up the blood pools and consume the bloody skeletons if your 
health falls below 11%. 
 
2.10 WHAT IS 'DEATH CAM'? HOW IS IT ACTIVATED? 
 
Death Cam is a animation replay of the final few seconds of the killing 
sequence of some the games bosses (you know, the huge guards). The only bosses 
subject to Death Cam are: 
	Dr. Schabbs (episode 2) 
	Hitler (episode 3) 
	Otto Giftmacher (episode 4) 
	General Fettgesicht (episode 6) 
The Death Cam is activated after you kill one of these bosses. After the replay 
the current episode concludes regardless of whether you killed all other 
guards, etc. 
There is no Death Cam in Spear. It has a nice set of end screens though. 
 
 NOTE: Deathcam does not replay your killing, from your viewpoint - it just 
 shows all the guy's dying frames from close up, so it is always the same. 
 
2.11 WHAT IS THE JUKEBOX FEATURE OF WOLFENSTEIN? HOW IS IT ACCESSED? 
 
The JukeBox feature of Wolfenstein is just a menu of different music 
scores that normally play through the different levels of Wolfenstein. 
To access it press and hold 'm' while Wolfenstein starts (after you started 
it from DOS). 
Now you can listen to that favourite tune from the game. 
The Jukebox is present in all versions as I understand (shareware/registered 
1.0 through to 1.4). The menu of music scores may be different between 
the versions but it nevertheless is there. 
 
2.12 WHAT ARE THOSE MUSIC TUNES IN WOLFENSTEIN? 
 
What is the theme music for Wolfenstein 3-D? 
 
The tune that opens Wolf 3-D is known as the "Horst Wessel Lied" (Horst 
Wessel's Song), which was the official Nazi party anthem.  Here are the 
first couple of bars to the lyrics, though further research will follow: 
 
(translated from the original German) 
 
Raise high the flags! Stand rank-on-rank together.... SA will march with 
steady, quiet tread.... 
 
Historical background:  Horst Wessel was an average SA (Sturmabteilung -- 
literally, Storm Detachment; which was the Nazi goon squad) trooper and 
local party leader in Berlin.  He was killed in a street brawl with 
Communists in 1930, but not before leaving the words and music to the tune 
that became the Nazi anthem.   It was played along with the official German 
national anthem, whose tune is still used today, although with different 
lyrics than what was played in Nazi Germany. 
 
Other musical trivia: a few bars of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and 
Marine Corps anthems are played throughout the game.  In one of the music 
pieces, a Morse-code message is played in the background... 
 
 The music on episode 1, mission 9 is vaguely reminiscent of the British 
 National Anthem, God Save The Queen/King (depending on who is the monarch 
 at the time). 
 
2.13 WHAT IS THAT MORSE CODE MESSAGE IN WOLFENSTEIN? 
 
In Episodes 3 & 6 of the registered version the music seems to 
include a Morse code beeping in the background. 
 
I have scooped the following from UseNet's comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action 
(I don't know the originator, you know who you are) 
 
Here it is: 
 
TO BIG BAD WOLF DE ["de" means "from" in amateur radio Morse code jargon] 
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD 
ELIMINATE HITLER 
IMPERATIVE   COMPLETE MISSION WITHIN 24 HOURS 
OUT 
 
2.14 ARE THERE ANY MORE CHEATS/HINTS AVAILABLE? 
 
Yes Siree! There's certainly that Wolfenstein hintbook you can obtain for some 
extra $ (US$ 10 I last heard), when you order the full version of the game. 
It's supposed to be packed with hints about the game levels and how to cheat in 
the game (--> See 1.10). I don't know all the details 'cause I don't have it. 
(Er, the game's too easy anyway (No flames! --> See 3.X)) 
There's also the Spear of Destiny hintbook to be obtained for US$ 15. 
It has lots of background info on the game, the storyline, its development 
history and the guys at iD Software, plus hints for playing, the full set of 
printed maps and how to access a few hidden features in the program.

3.0 THE FLAMING SECTION. (YOU'RE ANNOYED WITH WOLFENSTEIN BECAUSE...) 
=============================================================================== 
 
3.1 IT CRASHES. 
 
Usually the reasons for Wolfenstein bombing out are these: 
 
1) You have a hardware conflict with your soundcard. 
2) You have a software configuration problem. 
3) You have more than one version of Wolfenstein and some game files from the 
   versions are mixed. 
 
1 & 2 are discussed later --> See 6.1 & 6.2 
 
If you mixed Wolfenstein versions or put different home-brew add-on maps in the 
same directory then Wolfenstein might hang since map and graphics file formats 
are different from version 1.1 onwards. 
 
3.2 THE SOUNDS ARE ALL SCREWED. 
 
Either your card is not fully Soundblaster compatible or you have IRQ or DMA 
conflict. --> See 6.1 
 
3.3 YOU ARE LEFT WITH A GUN AND 8 BULLETS AFTER YOU DIE. 
 
Solution 
a) Cheat (--> See 1.10) 
b) Learn about secret rooms and how to find them (--> See 3.10), there is 
   plenty of ammo/food inside them. 
c) Save often. 
d) The blue SS troopers carry machine guns. Toast one with your gun and you can 
   pick up his machine gun. If you have the machine gun already, he just drops 
   an ammo pouch. 
 
3.4 IT'S TOO HARD. 
 
--> See 3.3 & 3.10 
Also start on an easy difficulty level. Don't despair, you'll get better. One 
of the advantages of veteran players is that they know the layout of the maze. 
They know where to find ammo, food, etc. 
As you get familiar with the game you'll also be able to judge how many shots to 
fire and where to aim. Thus you can conserve your ammo. 
To preserve health learn how to use the strafe function (useful when ducking 
around corners). 
Also don't just plunge into rooms. Hang back and see if any guards come running 
out. Then ... Pang! 
Some difficulty can also be attributed to disorientation of new players. 
Several corridors or rooms may look alike. Try look for dead bodies (i.e. the 
trail that you've left behind) or other characteristic objects. 
If you're having trouble with movement then --> See 3.6 & 3.7 
One nice hint I've received is about slowing the game a little. If you have 
turned on debugging keys then holding TAB slows the game down a bit (not as 
slow as slow motion from the debugging options). This means that you can let 
off a couple of accurate shots before the targets (guards etc.) have time 
to react. Great for some tight rooms and conserves ammo as well. 
 
3.5 IT'S TOO EASY. 
 
Like a challenge eh? Check out some home-brew maps. --> See 5.1 
You might also try to reduce your health with the cheat mode (--> See 1.10) 
or decide to play without machine guns. Take that for a challenge. 
 
3.6 YOU KEEP RUNNING INTO THE WALLS AND MISSING THE DOORS. 
 
Sounds like a major new user disorientation syndrome to me, but could also be 
attributed to a slow computer. See, slower machines sacrifice the frame rate to 
keep the gameplay speed constant. Thus you might miss a few frames here and 
there and that will fool you into overshooting your targets (doors, guards when 
you're aiming your pistol at them, etc.) Strafe function helps here sometimes. 
You can also try experimenting with various input devices. Mouse is more 
accurate on position but slower when it comes to movement. Joystick is rather 
inaccurate but easy to handle and still slow. Especially your rotation speed. 
If you have a Thrustmaster or other joystick + configurable buttons you can 
program these for strafe & run functions. That should make it a little easier. 
 
3.7 YOU ARE FEELING DIZZY WHILE YOU PLAY IT. 
 
There have been a lot of discussion about this phenomenon. In short some people 
experience dizziness attributed to the game movement. There were many theories, 
most along the line of motion sickness. 
Some also said that the animation is too smooth so it fools your brain into 
believing it to be real. Others said its too jerky and it makes you vomit like 
being sea sick. Another popular theory is that lack of proper acceleration 
(like on-off high speed) attribute to the nausea. 
I will not go into discussion of why. Rather I'll post some steps people 
suggested. Remedies are not guaranteed to work. There are many, all are 
experimental and some will have opposite effects on different people. This, it 
seems, is a very individual problem. 
 
a) Try different display sizes. Either different size monitors or use the F5 
   function to vary the display window. 
b) Try sitting closer/further from the display (but don't stick your nose in 
   it, I don't want you to get radiation sick). Combine with focusing/ 
   defocusing on the display or surroundings (your room, etc.) This is to see 
   if you're being aware that you're looking at the monitor (by seeing other 
   objects around it) and hopefully it may convince your brain that what you 
   play is not really real. 
c) Try different machine speeds. If you have a turbo switch try playing with 
   it on/off. See what the difference is. 
d) Try different input devices (--> See 3.6) With a mouse you can control 
   acceleration more accurately than with a joystick or the keyboard. 
e) Play on your friend's/collegue's computer. See if it's better/worse. 
f) Have breaks while you play. Play in turns. Watch others play & then play 
   yourself. 
g) If you have Soundblaster try playing with/without the sound. If your 
   soundcard is stereo try playing with headphones on. Reverse the headphones 
   so that left becomes right. Does it confuse you more. (It has no difference 
   on me if you want to know ;) This one is not meant as a torture (Hehe) only 
   to see if you're generally well adaptive. 
 
After I switched machines from 386SX-25Mhz to 486DX-33Mhz I had problem 
adjusting too. Everything seemed "too smooth". Now when I see it on the 386 it 
makes me want to vomit. Sometimes you'll have to give it time to adjust. 
 
3.8 IT NEVER GIVES YOU 100% STATS AT THE END OF LEVEL/GAME. 
 
Hmm, must have missed some treasure/secret room/enemies. 
 
Solution: 
1) Improving secret room ratio --> See 3.10 
2) Improving treasure ratio = Improving secret ratio since most remaining 
   treasure you missed is probably hidden. 
3) Improving kill ratio. 
   A few dogs running wild may be the cause. 
   There's also a few places in the maze where the guards can follow you in 
   circles. Back up your tracks, you might smash into one around the corner. 
 
3.9 YOU ALWAYS RUN OUT OF AMMO/HEALTH. 
 
There's plenty of ammo/food/first aid around to last to twice the fun. Problem 
is knowing where to find it. Be careful to not leave behind ammo clips dropped 
by guards after you kill them. Its only 4 rounds but it adds up. Sometimes 
ammo/food/first aid is concentrated in a couple of rooms on a level. If you 
find that cache you'll have no problems. Some levels have relatively little 
food/first aid but lots of ammo. It may be wise to plan ahead and stay healthy 
for that level. You can also plainly waste ammo and overshoot ensuring you'll 
be hit as little as possible. Other levels may have little ammo and lots of 
food/first aid. Adopt ammo saving strategy there. 
Remember that extra-life sphere boosts both your health and ammo. 
Also --> See 3.10 
 
3.10 YOU CAN NEVER FIND ANY SECRET ROOMS. 
 
Secret rooms usually house most of the treasure, ammo and health bonuses as 
well as machine guns and extra lives. 
 
Some "obvious" places where a secret room may be located are shown below: 
 
NOTE: W  = wall, o = static object like: barrel, drum, plant, etc. 
	  #  = different wall panel like: Hitler's painting, Nazi banner, etc. 
	  [  = Sliding door. 
	  Possible secret doors are pointed to by < ^ and > or shown as ? 
 
a) Different wall panels 
 
WWWWWWWW#WWWWWWW#WWWWWWWW 
W       ^       ^       W 
W                       W 
# <                     [ 
W                       W 
W                       W 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 
 
b) Room corners. 
 
W?WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW?W 
?                       W 
W                       W 
W                       [ 
W                       W 
?                       W 
W?WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW?W 
 
c) Between objects and at midpoints of a wall. 
 
WWWWWWWWWWWW?WWWWWWWWWWWW 
Wo                      W 
?                       W 
Wo                      [ 
W                       W 
W               o o     W 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW?WWWWWWW 
 
d) In narrow alcoves 
 
	W?W 
	? ? 
	? ? 
WWWWWWWWW WWWWWWWWWW 
W                  W 
[                  [ 
W                  W 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 
 
e) On wall panel in straight line extending from an object 
   (classic object in this example is an overhead lamp!) 
 
WWWWWWW?WWWWWWWWWWW 
W 
W 
[      o               <-- A corridor 
W 
W 
WWWWWWW?WWWWW 
 
NOTE: Some secret rooms have secret rooms within them. Sometimes secret 
	  movable panels can be moved to block each other. Be careful not to 
	  block yourself in. This is also why sometimes you cannot get 100% 
	  secret ratio for some levels. 
 
3.11 YOU CAN NEVER FIND A SECRET LEVEL. 
 
Well, if you read Section 2.4 you'd know that you need to find a secret level 
elevator to get to a secret level. These elevators are hidden inside secret 
rooms (that is, behind pushwall passages). They can be pretty darn hard to find 
without a map. To get you going here's one from episode one. 
 
WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Here we go. The secret level elevator for episode 1 is on level 1! It is 
accessible by a series of secret doors (pushwalls) in the last room of that 
level (the room with the normal elevator). I've drawn the room out below. 
 
 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW    L = the room with the normal

3.12 YOU ALWAYS GET NUKED BY THAT BIG BAD BOSS (GUARD) AT THE END. 
	 (THE STRATEGIES FOR DEFEATING THE BOSSES). 
 
Note: This section is *far* from complete. Why not send in your hints 
	  for wiping those tough guys at the end. 
 
--- 
Well, here's a general guide submitted by Douglas Bottoms  
(BOTTOMS_DOGLAS_J@Lilly.com) 
 
"Usually, I try to get as close to the boss as possible, then back STRAIGHT 
away from the boss while firing. Then strafing left or right to hide behind 
a wall (or get out of the way)." 
--- 
 
Note: You will find that most boss scenarios conveniently include blocks 
of wall behind which you can hide while the boss fires its 'salvo'. 
 
Here is a specific one pertaining the Mad Doc at end of Episode 2. 
 
--- 
Episode 2: This is the Mad Doctor who is creating all the Zombies. If you go 
at him straight on he'll just zap you with his syringes and you'll go all 
red-eyed and die. If you go to the corridor to the left of the room where 
he's hiding and wait for him to come out you can zap him with the old chain 
gun from the side. There's also a first-aid kit in there which helps. Once 
he's retired back to the room rush out to the beginning of the level where 
there is a secret room (which you will already have opened up) full of ammo 
clips and restock on ammo. Now you can go back in for a frontal assault and 
 finish him off. This guy doesn't fire much - I hit him a bit, get out of 
 the way, hit him a bit, get out of the way... 
--- 
  
.and here is one specific one for Hitler at the end of Episode 3. 
--- 
Episode 3: Hitler is to the left of the entrance to the final room in the 
final level. Hit him with the chain gun until his armor drops away. Then 
rush down to the end and turn right, knock off the 2 white guards in there 
and you'll find lots of extra ammo and some first aid. If you lurk here 
Hitler may come after you - in which case blast him, or if you wait long 
enough he'll seem to go away. If this happens go right back to the beginning 
of the level where there is a secret room full of ammo and stock up because 
you'll find he's trailed you. So turn round fast and give him everything 
you've got. 
  
 
4.0 MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS SECTION 
=============================================================================== 
 
4.1 DISCUSSION OF AVAILABLE MAP/GRAPHICS EDITORS. 
 
There are 6 map/graphics editors available as far as I know. 
 
a) MAPEDIT v4.1 - Map editor. 
 
a) MAPEDIT v4.2 - Map editor. 
 
a) MAPEDIT v6.0 - Map editor. 
 
a) MAPEDIT v8.0 - Map editor. 
 
b) WOLFMAP v1.6 - Map editor/version convertor. 
 
c) WOLFEDIT v2.1 - Graphics editor/extractor. 
 
Mapedit v4.1 
	- Written by Bill Kirby (who incidentally retired from working on his 
	  creation). 
	  This software will let you edit Wolfenstein's maps for any version 
	  released to date (1.0 through to 1.4). It will recognize if your copy 
	  is shareware, or registered (3 episode or 6 episode). 
	  Turbo Pascal source is included so you can make your own adjustments. 
	  NOTE: Not compatible with SoD. 
 
	This is the 'vanilla' version of this editor. Many have changed this 
	version to produce their custom 'enhanced' editors with more features 
	etc. (Thus this version is where the version tree splits). 
	The following two are the most popular. 
 
Mapedit v4.2 
	- Written by Ralf Seider (rauh@wrcd1.uni-wcppertal.de) 
	  Some new functions were added to v4.1 
	  - Item selection memory while editing. 
	  - Can select items from map (pick up using mouse) 
	  - Fill & rectangle functions for easier level construction. 
	  NOTE: Not compatible with SoD. 
 
Mapedit v6.0  
	- Written by Dave Huntoon & Brian Baker 
	  Some bugs of v4.1 fixed. 
	  Some new functionality added 
	  - Copy, Paste 
	  - Exchange (maps) 
	  - Help (ah, user friendly) 
	  - Write / Read individual levels to / from disk 
	  - Statistics display (# of actors on level etc.) 
	  - Compatibility with SoD. 
 
Mapedit v8.0 [*** FAQ editor's choice ***] 
 
	- Written by Warren Buss, David Huntoon and Bryan Baker 
	  - Blake Stone compatibility 
	  - Zap function 
	  - Loads of other useful stuff! 
 
Wolfmap - Written by Jan Peter Dijkstra (Sysma Automatisering). 
	  This one was based on v old version of Mapedit but then evolved into 
	  an editor of its own. 
	  It's really more of a Wolfenstein map processor with functions such 
	  as: version conversion, level map export into intermediate file 
	  (allows moving and copying of levels), level ASCII dump for printing 
	  purposes, etc. The editor is really based on Mapedit visually with 
	  slightly more functionality. C++ source included. 
	  NOTE: Not compatible with SoD. 
 
Wolfedit - Written by Bill Kirby (again!). This is a must if you want to change 
	   Wolfenstein's graphics. Not only does it let you edit the wall 
	   panels as well as images of guards and various objects. You can also 
	   export/import images as GIF files. This makes editing with your 
	   favorite paintbrush tool easy. The picture size is limited to 64x64 
	   pixels but for importing images you can position a square on a 
	   larger image and snap it into the editor. 
	   Wolfedit will not read SoD graphics file as such (VSWAP.SOD file). 
	   If you're trying to edit SoD graphics then just rename your 
	   VSWAP.SOD file to VSWAP.WL6 before editing. Rename it back after 
	   you finished. 
 
4.2 RULES TO FOLLOW WHEN EDITING. 
 
IMPORTANT! READ THIS! IMPORTANT! READ THIS! IMPORTANT! READ THIS! IMPORTANT! 
******************************************************************************** 
First of all I would like to stress that iD Software and Apogee are not 
responsible for the home-brew add-ons floating around. They will offer 
you no support whatsoever if you encounter problems with them so 
DO NOT CALL Apogee about them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Even when Wolfenstein bombs out with an error message giving you the 
1-800 number of Apogee DO NOT CALL if you were playing the non-original 
maps/graphics. Apogee especially DOES NOT appreciate it. 
If you want to get help about it read the rest of this section. If you find 
no clues post to comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action for help. 
******************************************************************************** 
 
Ok, Here's a few guidelines if you're just starting to play around with the 
editors. I thought I'd put something down that might save you from screaming 
ARGHHH!! after a few hours of editing. Most of these are just a few pointers. 
 
- First of all save your work often. This one needs no explanation. 
- Also test it often. Some editing quirks will produce game bugs that are just 
  plain hard to get rid off. That might mean you'll have to start editing that 
  level from scratch. 
 
Mapping hints: 
	- When placing elevators, put them like this:   
	 
   ******************** 
   *                  *E 
   [                  D E 
   *                  *E 
   ******************** 
 
   [ = Normal door 
   D = Elevator door 
   E = Elevator segment. 
 
	  Landscape objects are similar in that they are displayed as landscape 
	  when aligned east/west and as starry skies when aligned north/south. 
	  If you REALLY want to have elevators north/south then the elevator 
	  lever would have to be one of the side panel (as you enter the 
	  elevator). 
	- Secret elevator needs floor number 6B (hex) inside it to work 
	  properly. 
	- Mobile guards and dogs can have arrows (turning points) to direct 
	  them. Place these on the path you want them to move. When they notice 
	  you they'll obviously break from that pattern, otherwise they'll 
	  follow it. If no turning points are set, they will keep on walking in 
	  the direction you set them off in, walking through walls and everything. 
	  In other words, SET TURNING POINTS! 
	- Note that when placing guards and dogs on the same arrowed path 
	  you might screw up the pattern since dogs are faster than the guards 
	  and will finally 'bunch up' behind them. 
	  See map of episode 1 level 2 for an example of this. 
	- Number of objects on one level is limited to 399. 
	  Secret doors and guard guiding arrows are NOT objects. 
	  Actors are not objects either. 
	- Number of actors (guards/dogs, etc.) on one level is limited to 149. 
	  Note that dead guards are considered actors too. 
	- Number of doors (sliding doors, NOT secret doors) on one level is 
	  limited to 64. This includes unlocked, locked and elevator doors. 
	- Don't forget you need an entrance to a level. 
	- You also should have an exit or game end trigger (see level 9 of the 
	  shareware version to see how it's done.) 
	- The exit must be the elevator icon unless you changed the graphic. 
	- Exit from level 9 leads to level 10. Thus you can have 10 straight 
	  levels with no secret level. 
	- Secret doors can "collapse" onto one another. Thus if you have many 
	  secret doors in a row with only the first secret door positioned over 
	  a wall you can repeatedly push the same wall panel. 
	- Too many guards in one room or area will result in the disappearing 
	  bodies phenomenon. --> See 6.3 
	- Only guards over the same floor as you will hear you shoot your gun. 
	  Since this concept is quite important to game strategy here's a 
	  little explanation: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
If you fire your weapon (this does include the knife but only if you actually 
poke someone) in a room then all the non-deaf guys in the same room who 
stand/walk over the same floor values will hear you. That is they will become 
active and try hunt you down. 
Also guys in other rooms which are not connected to your present room at the 
moment (What I mean is the doors between that room and your current room where 
you are are closed) will also hear you if they stand/move over the same floor 
value. 
This allows for a variety of dynamic effects, e.g. see below:

Here's a quick sketch of 3 rooms (walls=W) connected by sliding doors [. 
You (Y) are in room 1.  Rooms 1 & 3 have the same type of floor.  Room 2 has 
a different type of floor.  G1-G5 are guards. 
If you shoot your weapon in room 1 then guards G1, G2 as well as G5 will 
become aware of your presence (G1 & G2 probably are already aware of you if 
they saw you).  G5 will run from room 3 to room 2 (tracking your position in 
straight line).  Eventually he would get to room 1.  If you fire your weapon 
while either of the doors are open then G3 & G4 will will become aware of you 
too. 
NOTE: You didn't open either doors (I'm assuming G5 or G3 or G4 does that) 
	  unless you ran for it ;) 
 
The first floor value in the Mapedit/Wolfmap editor index is the DEAF floor 
(hex value=6A; this should be annotated in map editors). 
The guards standing on deaf floors will react only if you pass within their 
sight (that seems to span slightly less than 180 degrees (~90 either side of 
their face)). 
 
Note that if you mix floors in one room (other than the DEAF floor) then only 
the floor which connects to the door through which you entered will become 
active.  Guards standing on other floors will be oblivious to you unless you 
shoot at them (not sure if you can run through them). 
 
In a way when you enter through the sliding doors a change of active floor 
takes place (after the door shuts --> while it's open both floor values are 
active). 
 
A classic example is when you enter a room through a secret door.  If the 
floor in that room is different then no guard in that room will respond to 
you shooting. 
 
If you're still unclear about this here's an explanation by iD's 
J. Romero (straight from the horse's mouth so to speak): 
 
"Wolfenstein 3-D is basically made up of a lot of closed 
rooms.  When you open a door, the guards get a chance to 
see you and opening the door connects your sound area to 
the revealed room's sound area, so a gunshot will be heard 
in both places. Guards in both places will respond to this 
kind of action". 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
	- Putting an object inside a wall allows you and other actors to walk 
	  through that wall. Now you know how that guard jumped you from the 
	  wall. 
	- Directing moving actors (guards, dogs, etc.) into a wall of unity 
	  thickness makes that square wall panel permeable. That is you can 
	  walk through it in the same way as if you used the wall walking 
	  cheat. (--> See 1.10) 
	- You must have a minimum of at least the following on any level you 
	  create: 
	  1 enemy (guard, dog, etc...) 
	  1 piece of treasure (cross, jewels, etc...) 
	  1 secret door 
	  They are needed because Wolfenstein tries to calculate the % of each 
	  of that you have killed, opened, picked up, etc..., and if there are 
	  0 items of any one of the above, Wolfenstein will crash trying to 
	  divide by zero. 
	- Secret doors can pass over/through any object that you can (kitchen 
	  utensils, food, etc.) EXCEPT Dead Guards. 
	- Be careful not to set up secret doors that might go beyond the edge 
	  of either the bottom or left-hand sides. The top and right hand edges 
	  of the "world" are solid, but the left and bottom sides are permeable 
	  (no range checking), and weird things can happen. 
	- Be careful not to set up secret doors such that a small passage 
	  behind them is blocked when the 'pushwall moves too far' phenomenon 
	  occurs. Either insure that the pushwall can move only 2 grid 
	  locations or enlarge the passage. --> See 6.3 
	- Doors should be parallel to the walls you are inserting them in, as 
	  you will get phantom blocks of grey stone otherwise. 
	  Try placing a door all by itself without any walls and you will see 
	  that it is accompanied by two phantom walls on either side. This has 
	  presumably something to do with the opening act of a door (???). You 
	  can go through these blocks, and even open the doors within them. 
	  To clarify that here's a sketch of a door just by itself with no 
	  walls around: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
		P[P 
 
		 ^ 
 
	  [ - Door 
	  P - Phantom wall block 
	  ^ - Direction you face when opening the door. 
 
 
	  Now, if you place the door perpendicular to the wall its embedded in 
	  here's what you'll end up with: 
 
		  P 
	  WWWWWWWW[WWWWWW 
		  P 
 
	  Obviously you can't see the door until you pass through the P wall. 
	  BTW: The phantom walls P look like the regular stone wall (or the 
		   first wall in the graphics file for that matter). 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
	- Deaf Guard floors directly in front or behind a sliding door result 
	  in the door being invisible. The floor seems to be replaced with a 
	  "force field" (it becomes an invisible wall). 
	  Of course, if what you want is an invisible barrier, then this is how 
	  to do it. 
	  Note that if you put a Deaf Guard in an elevator, you will not be 
	  able to get in! (I think this only occurs in v1.0 of Wolfenstein, 
	  later versions allow you to have deaf elevator floors) 
	- If you make regular sliding doors into secret doors, they behave 
	  rather strangely, when you "open" them. They move away and transform 
	  into a random wall panel. 
	- Placing two or more doors side-by-side will produce a bizarre "picket 
	  fence" wall of crazed wall panels, and will not allow you to pass 
	  through them (except the last door on the right side) but will let 
	  the bad guys through. 
 
Editing the graphics, hints: 
	--> See later part of 4.5 
 
4.3 COMMON EDITING ERRORS (WHAT NOT TO DO AND WHAT THEY'LL PRODUCE). 
 
	- You forgot to put an entry position into a level. 
	  When you start that level you'll find that you can't move around and 
	  you see walls in all directions. 
	- You put too many guards in one level. 
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering 
	  that level: 
	  'GetNewActor: No free spots in objlist!' 
	- You put too many objects in one level. 
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering 
	  that level: 
	  'Too many static objects' 
	- You put too many doors in one level. 
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when entering 
	  that level: 
	  '64+ doors on level' 
	- You included in your shareware episode map some objects used in 
	  non-shareware episodes only. 
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when that 
	  object/wall comes into your view: 
	  'Tried to load sparse page' 
	  If you patch the map and try to continue from the last saved position 
	  within the same level, you'll still get this error as Wolfenstein 
	  stores the map as loaded on level entry in the save-game file. You 
	  must restart from a saved position in the previous level. 
	  Hint: always save before taking up the exit elevator of a level. 
	- You have mixed versions of Wolfenstein maps or have corrupted 
	  map files. 
	  Wolfenstein will terminate with the following error when you start 
	  the play: 
	  'Map not 64x64' 
	  Usually this is due to the fact that you might have only one 
	  MAPHEAD.??? file in the editor's directory and many 
	  MAPTEMP.???/GAMEMAPS.??? files. In short you're confusing the program. 
	  Determine which map files are the ones you want to play and clean up 
	  the directory. 
	- One more error which I cannot attribute to anything I know can occur. 
	  It happens when you die for the first time on a level. Wolfenstein 
	  kicks out with this message: 
	  'MM_GetPtr: Out of Memory!' 
	  This can occur in spite of the fact that the level has few actors or 
	  objects and there's plenty of RAM around. 
	  If you know how to fix it or what the cause is let me know. 
 
4.4 MAP/GRAPHICS FILES VERSION CONVERSION. 
 
Map files version conversion: 
	Wolfmap 1.6 can convert between any version of Wolfenstein map files. 
	Maps for versions 1.1 and higher are considered equivalent. 
	Note though that not all wall panels map directly to the same panels 
	through this conversion. In particular the false door of v1.0 has been 
	removed and after conversion to v1.1 will appear as a mud-wall which 
	will cause you problems if the maps were only the 1-episode shareware 
	which doesn't have the graphic for that wall. 
	In short: don't trust the conversion. Look through the maps carefully 
	to see if something has gone wrong. I suspect some objects are 
	converted to 'unknown' objects as described by the editors. 
	Also by using Mapedit 6.0 you can convert between versions of 
	Wolfenstein 'by hand' using the individual map import / export 
	facility. Just load up maps of one version, export all the levels 
	to disk (one at a time). Quit the editor, restart with map files 
	of a different version and import those individual levels in. 
	Note: This does mean you have to have the destination version map 
	file available (as a place holder for the imported maps). 
 
Graphic files version conversion: 
	No known convertors exist. If you know one let me know. 
	Yes, that does mean you'll have to import all the walls etc. as GIFs 
	into the version of the file you want. 
 
4.5 EDITORS COMPATIBILITY WITH THE GAME AND EACH OTHER. 
Mapedit, Wolfmap and Wolfedit are compatible with all versions of Wolfenstein 
from 1.0 to 1.4 shareware and both of the registered releases. 
Mapedit 6.0 and 8.0 will also read/write SoD files. For Wolfmap you'll need  
new definition files. --> See 5.3 
 
Wolfmap is compatible with Mapedit, but Mapedit is NOT compatible with Wolfmap. 
That is, files processed by Wolfmap are not readable by Mapedit. 
 
Sometimes the objects edited do not always appear as they should. An example is 
missing sliding doors when they were placed in the map. The door vacancy is 
present instead but you cannot move through it. Someone suggested that this 
can by fixed by changing floor values next to the object/door in question. 
You can also move the door to another place on the wall. 
I know it may stuffup your design but it should help. 
NOTE: Placing a deaf-floor by the door will always make it invisible. For some 
	  reason v1.0 of Wolfenstein experiences more of these problems (?). 
Also --> See 4.2 
 
Wolfedit has no major problems with wall panel graphics. There are some 
problems when it comes to objects such as lamps, dog food, guards, etc. It 
seems each object has a 'size' parameter. Editing the object may overrun that 
limit. Wolfedit won't let you save the file if any objects are at fault. 
Curiously even editing the colour (shade) of an object may adversely affect it. 
Most importantly though objects need to have a blank background. This is 
denoted by the bright pink background colour in the Wolfedit editor. (Have a 
look at some standard objects that came with Wolfenstein.) 
 
4.6 HOW TO MAKE A HARDCOPY (PRINTOUT) OF THE MAPS. 
 
I recall there are four ways. 
1) Use printscreen key + graphics.com program under DOS to capture the screen 
   of one of the map editors. 
2) Use Wolfmap's ASCII map dump feature. Then print it as any file. There are 
   also other utilities for that. --> See 5.3 
3) Capture map screen under Windows and print it later (costly on ribbon or 
   toner since in bitmap mode). 
4) Use a TSR screen shot utility such as PCX-Dump to dump a screen from one 
   of the editors. Then print it as you would a graphics file. 
NOTE: If you only want maps to original Wolfenstein then there are some already 
	  made. --> See 5.3 
 
 
5.0 WOLFENSTEIN ADD-ON SECTION. 
=============================================================================== 
 
All of the programs listed in this section can be found on the two ftp sites 
mentioned in Section 0.7 
I will not include anything herein until it finds its way to either of these 
two sites. 
 
Version number in square brackets indicates which version of Wolfenstein you 
will need with the specific programs listed. Also archive file extensions were 
omitted (.zip .arj etc.) unless they differentiate two different add-ons 
with otherwise same archive name. 
For example: [1.1 S] means version 'The shareware version 1.1'. 
 
I have also included my own rating (number of *'s). This is merely my opinion 
of the maps/graphics originality/artwork & bloodbath factor. 
* = tame/yawn, ***** = suicidal!/wicked! 
 
Note: The shareware version of Wolf3D has been ranked '*' for bloodbath 
factor at Death incarnate level to compare with ratings given to other maps 
at the same level. This is in no way to hint at its playability and is just 
for comparison purposes. 
Remember versions 1.1 to 1.4 are equivalent! 
 
To install any of the maps/graphics sets, just ensure you have the correct 
version of Wolf3D and copy the files that came with the archive into your 
Wolf3D directory (unless specifically stated otherwise. See below or 
documentation that came with the add-on if any.) 
 
Lastly if anyone knows of anymore maps etc. let me know eh? 
 
5.1 EXTRA LEVELS. 
 
- map1      [1.0 S] *   - Only level 1 was appreciably changed from 
				  original maps. 
- newwmap   [1.0 S] **  - Maps are the same as original. Only more 
				  guards were added. 
- wlfnwmap  [1.0 S] **  - All levels were changed. Levels 4,6,7 & 8 
				  are very short & differ only in wall color. 
- wlfset11  [1.0 S] *** - Extension Set One v1.1. All levels apart 
				  from 1, 4 & 10 were designed from scratch. 
				  Docs included. 
- wolfmap   [1.0 S] *** - All levels are different from original. 
				  Quite challenging. 
- nitemare  [1.0 S] *** - Enigma's Nitemare I. Level 1 was greatly 
				  changed. Others redesigned from scratch. 
				  This one for really trigger happy! 
- enite-ii  [1.1 S] ****    - Enigma's Nitemare II. This archive contains 
				  maps + graphics replacements. All maps 
				  different from original. Graphics cool. 
				  Self-(de)installation (but you can bypass it 
				  if you're paranoid about viruses etc.). 
				  Intro + docs. 
- enite3fx  [1.1 S] *****   - This is the third installment of Enigma's 
				  Nitemare. In this package you'll find all 3 
				  nitemare parts (many bugs corrected) plus the 
				  graphics file as well. 
				  This archive has a full intro/installation 
				  with it so you need not mess with renaming 
				  the files. Read the doc before you start. 
				  For Wolf3D experts that one... 
- enm3-v30  [1.1 S] *****   - This is the same as enite3fx but has some 
				  more bugfixes. You should really get this 
				  instead of any other Enigma maps. 
- wolf316   [1.1 R] **  - First 30 maps were redesigned. This one quite 
				  'mazey'. This archive also includes new 
				  graphics file replacement. Guards have been 
				  replaced with men in shirts + ties. All nazi 
				  symbolism was replaced by 3:16 symbolism 
				  (3:16 is a drug of some sort - the game now 
				  has a drug cult worship of some kind). 
				  Food etc. replaced with the drug itself. 
				  Digitised sounds were also changed. 
				  Weapons changed to lasers now. 
- darkmap1  [1.0 S] *** 1/2 - DarkStar's Castle Wolfenstein-3D levels. 
				  All levels redesigned from scratch. 
				  Quite a toughie this one. 
- w3d_cc1   [1.1 R] ****    - A total of 58 new maps (2 secret levels were 
				  left unchanged). Not as hard as the Nitemare 
				  series but nevertheless very enjoyable. 
- sodblst2  [SoD R] ??? - Blast Brothers' Spear of Destiny levels. 
				  Level 1 greatly extended and all others 
				  redesigned from scratch. 
- sod_cc1   [SoD R] ****    - All 21 levels either partially or completely 
				  redesigned. Does a great job in keeping up 
				  the 'spirit' of the original levels. 
- insanity  [1.1 R] *****   - Temporary Insanity. By Nathaniel Rudiak-Gould. 
				  What can I say, these levels are truly insane. 
				  Enter 60 levels of mystery where pushing the 
				  wrong wall or firing a shot can spell ... 
				  Doom (no pun intended :). 
				  These maps use various undocumented features 
				  of Wolfenstein's engine to come up with a 
				  variety of effects such as: 
				  walk through walls/objects, self-moving wall 
				  blocks, invisible enemies, areas where you 
				  move uncontrolably, 'insanity areas' which 
				  make you lose your m/gun, red hot walls, 
				  unopenable doors, force fields, areas only 
				  accessible on certain difficulty levels etc. 
				  et al. 
				  So if you love solving riddles this one is 
				  definitely for you. It has a large (120K) 
				  hint file with it if you get frustrated. 
				  WARNING: This is definitelly not for all 
				  you "wham! bam! thank you 'mam" type action 
				  hero folks who like getting 100% stats every 
				  time. This one will require some brain power. 
- xmasswlf  [1.1 S] ****1/2 - The maps themselves will remind you of the 
				  originals. The characters, however, have 
				  been replaced with crazy Santas and Snowball 
				  throwing snowman. Sounds have changed too. 
				  Great Stuff. 
- wolfen60  [1.1 R] ****    - This is basically a collection of various  
				  levels floating around all rolled into  
				  one 6 episode package. You'll recognise 
				  a few of the levels from other add-ons. 
 - wolflev1  [1.1 R] (can't really rate it - I did it!)  - This is my set 
				  of levels - still in progress. So far, 17 levels done. 
 - warwolf   [1.1 R] (I did it, and still early stages)    - This is the 
				  all-new Warhammer Wolfenstein. All graphics will be changed 
				  (at the moment, a few wall panels and some of the guns are 
				  done) and it will be a full 60 levels. Looking BRILLIANT! 
 
5.2 EXTRA GRAPHICS. 
 
- wolfnpac  [1.0 S] **  - Replacement for the graphics file. The only 
				  change is that it replaces the brown guard 
				  with a 3D pacman sphere. Nice animation 
				  sequence though. 
- wlfnewgr  [1.0 S] **  - Replacement for the graphics file. Replaces 
				  ordinary wall panels with ... x-rated images. 
				  This one not for the kiddies ... although not 
				  greatly explicit. 
				  [WARNING! this add-on may be offensive!] 
- wolfus    [1.1 S] *1/2    - Wolf3D U.S. All nazi symbolism replaced with 
				  US symbolism. 
- w3dcool   [1.1 S] *** - This is basically a package that has been 
				  thrown together by someone. Don't get me 
				  wrong, its nice but most of the graphics come 
				  from SoD or registered Wolfenstein or other 
				  games like X-Wing (a few tie bombers around) 
				  and some real-life people etc. Try it for 
				  really weird playing environment. 
- wolfbonk  [?.? S] **  - Bonkenstien3D. Some graphics changed to 
				  appear more 'appealing'. Treasure replaced 
				  with computer supplies. Elevators replaced 
				  with moongates. Guns replaced with ... 
				  joysticks (?!!) 
- wolfclwn  [1.1 S] **1/2   - Wolfenstein meets the Demon Clowns of Death. 
				  The boring old brown SA guard replaced with 
				  a colorful clown. 
- wolfstf   [1.0 S] **1/2   - Wolfenstein-3d Street Fighter 2. 
				  All characters have been replaced with Ryu, 
				  Ken, and E. Honda. For SF2 die hard fans only. 
- wlfkosh1  [1.1 S] **  - Wolfenstein 3-D kosher. By: Peter Ringering 
				  Make your Wolfenstein 3-D a kosher game. 
				  Instead of shooting at people, you shoot at 
				  objects which will shoot at you. All the gory 
				  stuff was removed as well. PG-rated if you 
				  like. 
- 3dbusse   [?.? S] *1/2    - Some minor touches to the graphics. SS guard's 
				  m/guns now eject shells. Swastikas were 
				  removed. Soldiers now wear camouflage helmets 
				  & boots. Guns have targeting laser dots. 
- barney10  [1.0 S] *** - This the the famous Barney patch.  
				  Barney is the end of episode boss. The guards 
				  are replaced by Beavis & Butthead. The sounds 
				  are replaced also. 
- barney14  [1.1 S] *** - This the the same Barney patch for v1.1/1.4 
				  of Wolf3d. 
 
For more graphics see enm3-v30, and wolf316 in Section 5.1. 
 
5.3 OTHER ADD-ONS & UTILITIES. 
 
- w3dpatch  [1.0 S]     - This is an official patch release of the 
				  game to upgrade from version 1.0 to 1.1. 
- w6patch   [1.1 R]     - This is the map upgrade for the full version 
				  (6 episode) to version 1.2. Note though that 
				  this is not an official patch that will fix 
				  your version to say 1.2. Only the corrected 
				  map files (since this is an only difference 
				  between v1.1 & 1.2 anyway). 
- wcheat    [1.0 S]     - Edit Wolf3D save game files. Add ammo, 
				  health, guns, etc. 
- winwolf   [N/A]       - Some BMP files of graphics from the game. 
				  Great for Windows backdrop. 
- wmap41    [All]       - Generates ASCII maps of any level you like. 
				  Suitable for dump to printer. 
- wmaps-60  [All R]     - ASCII maps of all 6 episodes of the game. 
- wolf3d1.nfo   [1.0 S]     - Instructions on how to patch Wolfenstein 
				  for infinite ammo, health, etc. 
- wolfmaps  [All S]     - ASCII maps for the 1st (shareware) episode. 
- wolfspk4.exe  [All versions]  - This little utility will redirect digitised 
				  sounds in the game to the PC speaker. 
				  (For all of you people with no soundcard!) 
				  Some sounds come out a bit dodgy but all the 
				  shooting & screaming is audible. This file 
				  also works with Spear of Destiny. Note: there 
				  are other files like this e.g. wolfspk3.exe, 
				  wolfspk.exe, wolf1spk.exe, but wolfspk4.exe 
				  supercedes them. 
				  To revert back to PC squicker sounds 
				  delete CONFIG.WL? file. 
- wolfsnd   [1.1 Reg(6)]    - This is a little utility for exporting & 
				  importing digitised sounds from the VSWAP.WL6 
				  file. Reads/writes VOC files. 
				  Must have the full 6 episode version. 
- wfgrchrt  [All versions]  - A conversion chart showing the numbers (in 
				  decimal) for all objects contained in the 
				  various graphics files. 
- wlfaud11  [All S]     - Audio Editor v1.1 
				  Utility by Bill Neisius to export/import 
				  digitised samples from/to shareware versions 
				  of Wolfenstein. Will accept many formats 
				  (.AU, .VOC, .WAV, .SND etc.) 
				  Doesn't seem to handle ALL the sounds found in 
				  the VSWAP.WL1 file (first 20 I think). 
- allwolfsodmaps        - All Wolf3D and SoD maps (by Frans de Vries) 
				  Contains a small Unix routine to print them 
				  on separate pages. These WILL work on UNIX 
				  & DOS boxes. Created using wmap41 and the 
				  following add-on: 
- allwolfsodmapdefs     - New definition files for the Wolfmap editor 
				  (works with Mapedit v4.1 & v6.0 too :) and 
				  the wmap41 ASCII dump utility. Standardizes 
				  the legends, adds Spear definitions, improves 
				  a few colors and adds missing objects/walls. 
- ultwlf13  [?.? ?]     - Patches wolf for GUS support. Digitised 
				  sounds will be redirected to your GUS in 
				  native mode (No SBOS). Additionally some nice 
				  MOD soundtracks will play in the background. 
 
 
6.0 WOLFENSTEIN BUGS & PROBLEMS (KNOWN TO DATE), 
	AND HOW TO FIX OR GET AROUND THEM. 
=============================================================================== 
 
6.1 HARDWARE PROBLEMS. 
 
- Sound FX all screwed or cut out (SB + compat only). 
	If your sounds are short or hang the machine shortly into the game 
	then most likely you have an IRQ mismatch on your soundcard. Try 
	changing it. Good values are 5 & 7. 
	Also try DMA channel change, although #1 (default) should be ok. 
	... and don't forget to set your BLASTER variable in DOS like this: 
	(Best to put this in AUTOEXEC.BAT) 
 
	SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T4 
			 ^^^  ^  ^  ^ 
 
	A=??? port number for your soundcard. 
	I=? interrupt number for your soundcard. 
	D=? DMA channel number for your soundcard. 
	T=? Type of your sound card (must consult manual). 
	99% of the time you'll only need to fiddle around with I & T. 
	NOTE: the values pointed at may be different for you. 
		  Consult your SB & Computer manual. 
	As far as I know T4=SB Pro & T3=Regular Sb. 
	Dunno About others (anyone?). 
 
- You get some weird graphics on the screen then later the games hangs. 
	a) Change your SB IRQ number. Some graphics cards will clash with 
	   it (Don't ask me why, it could help...) 
	b) If your system is VLB you might try a newer Wolfenstein version. 
	   Try version 1.4 (since version 1.0 has a video problem) 
 
6.2 SOFTWARE PROBLEMS. 
 
- Game hangs. Sound hangs on last note. 
	Try getting rid of some TSRs. 
	Also some EMM managers can cause the problem with older versions of 
	Wolfenstein. 
	v1.1 is notorious for hanging under EMM386.EXE. The problem is 
	apparently related to VGA card compatibility. It seems some of the 
	earlier HiColor cards (15/16 bit RAMDACs) do not coexist peacefully 
	with Creative Labs. SB products. Some of the early SB chips are posing 
	some problems too. 
	If Wolfenstein hangs with EMM386 with EMS enabled (/RAM option) then 
	try the /NOEMS switch. If still no joy then try only HIMEM.SYS with 
	no EMM386 (extended memory only). 
 
- Game hangs or refuses to run with memory problems. 
	If you have DR-DOS 6.0 + QEMM with stealth then disable stealth mode. 
	Wolfenstein doesn't quite agree with it. 
 
- Game hangs at the 'Get Psyched' screen. 
	Err, you probably mixed some version numbers and have a very messy 
	directory with 999 add-on maps installed. Wolfenstein won't like that. 
 
- Game hangs with some horizontal stripes through the status bar. 
	- Heisen-bug, a glitch. Mostly with the add-on maps. 
	  Reboot, probably won't happen again. 
	- Also happens if you mixed versions of the VSWAP.??? file and of the 
	  game itself. Make sure you have the appropriate version of the game. 
 
- Game seems to run but all you can see is some weird graphics. 
	- Must have got a slightly corrupt VSWAP.??? file. Hope you have 
	  a backup somewhere (Nya Nya Nya!) 
	- You cheater! You tried to go above the last level 10 with the TAB-W 
	  cheat. Ha! (Yes this IS possible with some versions). 
	- Err, if you edited that map then you forgot to place level entrance 
	  somewhere (duh). 
 
6.3 GAME SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. 
 
- 'DISAPPEARING BODIES' phenomenon. This occurs when there are so many enemies 
  in your view at a time that the game stops displaying some. The game engine as 
  it seems is limited to only so many "sprites". Anything beyond that and you 
  won't be sure which guys will start disappearing. This only occurs on a 
  couple of levels in Wolfenstein I think. Be aware if you are editing your own 
  map! There is no fix. The engine is set and iD won't rework it. 
 
- 'PUSHWALL MOVES TOO FAR' phenomenon. This is when the pushwall (or secret door 
  if you prefer) moves TOO FAR and blocks your further passage into the room 
  full of goodies etc. I cannot recall if there is one in episode one, but 
  apparently there are at least two places where this occurs in episode 6. 
 
  Episode 6, level 2.  This is the FIRST pushwall in the map.  All others on 
  this level are *behind* it. 
 
  This is shown below: 
 
before pushing: 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWW   W   WWW 
		?*  WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
 
after pushing: 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWW   W   WWW 
		 ?   *  WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW   WWW 
 
  You are where the '*' is, and you push the pushwall '?'. 
  'W' is other parts of walls. 
  It's supposed to move two grid locations and stop, so you can go around it. 
  Instead, it moves three, and blocks everything. 
 
  NOTE: This does not always happen. That is, sometimes the pushwall will move 
	2 grid locations, i.e. correctly. 
	Also any interference from guards behind it is not connected with this 
	since that would prevent pushwall moving at all or impede it to move 
	only 1 grid location. 
 
  Solution: Well, it looks like there isn't one at the moment. 
  There was a suggestion of inserting "stacks 9, 256" in the config.sys file, 
  but this doesn't seem to help. 
  The only suggestion is to save frequently and if you experience the problem, 
  to start over from the last saved position. Maybe the pushwall moves back 
  correctly this time. 
 
7.0 WOLFENSTEIN SPIN-OFFS. 
=============================================================================== 
 
In this section of the FAQ, I will detail the many games which Wolfenstein 
has inspired. If you can't get enough Wolfenstein, get some of these! NB: 
I am not including RPG type games - ie Shadowcaster - as these have taken 
their inspiration more from Ultima Underworld. 
 
7.01 CATACOMB ABYSS. 
 
This was an iD game for those with EGA monitors, loosely based on the 
Wolfenstein engine. It was released by Gamer's Edge, who put nowhere near the 
same standard of presentation on it as Apogee would have. The sound was bad -  
no SB music! However, all this aside, Catacomb Abyss is a very good game. It 
introduced some new features. You fire fireballs, of which you have an 
unlimited number, at the undead enemies. Ha! Undead? DEAD! You can pick up 
spells, such as the machine-gun effect spell, which streams off a line of 
fireballs at the enemy. The graphics are nothing to write home about -  
"functional" is as far as it gets. However, this is highly recommended to 
Wolfenstein fans. 
 
7.02 BLAKE STONE 3D. 
 
This was the real sequel to Wolfenstein 3D. Released around the same time as 
Doom (oops), it was set in a futuristic setting. Very similar to Wolfenstein, 
although with more enemies, and some other new features, like food units, 
"intelligent" enemies, floor mounted enemies, remote-linked doors and a cool 
gun, the Plasma discharger. Basically a grenade launcher with a different 
name. This is a very atmospheric game which did not get the attention it 
deserved at the time, due to the release of... 
 
7.03 DOOM. 
 
Wow. What else can I say. This was (and still is) the ultimate 3D game. The 
major differences between this and Wolfenstein were: 
-Non-orthagonal walls (they can be at any angle to each other, not just 
90 degrees) 
-Different height levels 
-Different lighting levels (ie: it's bloody dark) 
-Weapons with different strengths (ie: the shotgun is more powerful than the 
chaingun, but it's not rapid-fire) 
-Real heavy-duty weapons (rocket-launcher? BFG-9000 (also known as the 
Antichrist) 
-Network, serial and modem multiplayer support 
-Armour (yes, i'm British) 
This is an absolute landmark of a game. If it isn't in your collection (and 
you've got a VGA 386 with 4MB of ram or better), go get it now. 
 
7.04 KEN'S LABYRINTH. 
 
This was knocked up by one guy after playing Wolfenstein, and it shows. Crap. 
Crap to the nth degree. Utter dog-poo. Don't waste the download time. 
 
7.05 HUGO'S NITEMARE 3D. 
 
This is an interesting game, firmly in the Wolfenstein mode. It puts a more 
"puzzly" face onto things. Certain guns are more effective against certain 
enemies. Try it if you liked Enigma for Wolfenstein (See Wolfenstein add-ons 
section). 
 
7.06 DOOM 2. 
 
The new sequel to Doom, sub-titled Hell On Earth. This added a few new enemies 
and a double-barreled shotgun. It is also insanely hard. You get about 50 
enemies in one room attacking you...on level 3! The general opinion is that 
it didn't add enough to Doom. 
 
7.07 TERMINATOR: RAMPAGE. 
 
A commercial Wolfenstein look-alike by Bethesda Softworks. This isn't very 
good, the main criticisms being that it is: 
a) Too slow 
b) Too complicated. 
It does have a good variety of weapons, though. 
 
7.08 CORRIDOR 7. 
 
This is another commercial offering, by Gametek. They licensed the Wolfenstein 
engine, and proceeded to totally mess it up, and produce a boring, slow, 
repetitive game. Oh dear...what a wasted oppurtunity. 
 
7.09 THE FORTRESS OF DR RADIAKI. 
 
This is yet another commercial offering, and has exactly the same criticisms 
as the others. 
 
7.10 OPERATION BODYCOUNT. 
 
See above. 
 
7.11 RISE OF THE TRIAD. 
 
This is Apogee's new stunner. It should be released around December 
(hopefully), and will feature digitised enemies, trillions of weapons, massive 
maps, different heights, look up/down, different lighting, shoot everything 
(windows, doors, walls, hamsters...)God power up (you become massive, and 
walk on enemy soldiers), Dog power-up (God backwards) where you become 
small (enabling you to go through small passages) and invincible, and bite 
enemies. It still has those orthoganal (at 90 degrees to each other) walls, 
though. Damn. 
 
7.12 HERETIC. 
 
This is a new game, by Raven Software, using the Doom engine. It should be 
coming out the same time as ROtT, and little is known about it other than 
the fact that it will be a fantasy setting (swords and sorcerors). 
 
7.13 DUKE NUKEM 3: 3D. 
 
Another new 3D game by Apogee's new offshoot, 3D Realms. You get the chance 
to fly a jetpack. Should be out first quarter 95. 
 
7.14 SHADOW WARRIOR 3D. 
 
Another 3D Realms release. Should introduce some interesting concepts, like 
throwing stars. First quarter 95. 
 
7.15 RUINS 3D. 
 
ANOTHER 3D Realms release. Set in a roughly Egyptian style. First quarter 95. 
 
7.16 QUAKE. 
 
This is the one iD are really into at the moment. This is going to go so far 
ahead on technology - one of the iD guys said that it would be sort of like 
"Doom = Pong". Among other things, it will have: 
-Proper gravity. 
-Character interaction. 
-Programmed on a client/server basis (READ: LOADS of people over a network). 
-Vehicles. 
-Look up and down. 
-Full world "hierarchy". 
-Totally modular (READ: Easily hackable...add-ons galore). 
-Maps made in 3D, not "forced" 3D (ie: 2D maps made 3D by the engine). 
We won't see it before 96, though.
