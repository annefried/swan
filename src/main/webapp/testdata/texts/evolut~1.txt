Intelligent Behavior Without AI:
An Evolutionary Approach

Copyright 1991 Neil Kirby

Introduction
This paper describes a way to give intelligent behavior to computer 
operated objects.  It traces the evolutionary approach used in the "Auto" 
program of the "Bots" family of games.  The Bots system is described to 
provide a context, and the results of each step in the evolution are 
discussed.  While the changes made are particular to the Auto program, 
the method is applicable to other programs.  The fundamentals of the 
method are:
    1.  Analyze good and bad behaviors.
    2.  Quantify parameters to new algorithms.
    3.  Apply constant evolutionary pressures by repeatedly testing.
The method has proven to be quite successful.  The Auto program has 
progressed from hopelessly poor play to well above average play skills 
without any formal AI methods.

The Basic Approach
The basic approach greatly resembles classical Darwinistic evolution.  
Start with simplistic behavior, however bad.  Simple behavior is best 
described as whatever is easiest to code.  Analyze the failures of the 
simple methods.  If available, observe the differences between successful 
behavior, especially that of human players, and the failures of the 
computer players.  The most difficult step is to identify the parameters 
that can be used to control successful behavior.  Once this has been 
done, use regular code to allow the program to react to these parameters.  
The process is completed by repeatedly testing in play.  The ease of fast, 
repeated play afforded by computerization accelerates the process.  This 
approach is easily observed in the Auto program.

The Bots Family of Games
The Auto, Aero, and Bots programs make up the Bots family of 
multiplayer, tactical ground and air combat games.  These run under the 
Unix System VTM operating system and are written entirely in the C 
programming language.  Bots and Auto deal with futuristic ground combat 
units loosely comparable to tanks while Aero deals with flying futuristic 
aircraft.  The Bots and Aero programs are used by human players and 
Auto is the computer managed equivalent to Bots.  The Bots family of 
games supports but does not require team play.  

Since the  Bots family are multiple player, multiple process games, events 
are performed simultaneously.  A unit can find out the actions of other 
units only after committing its own actions.  The events that make up a 
turn are motion, followed by active fire, and ending with passive fire.  After 
every ten turns, repair and resupply are made available to a unit.  The 
manner in which a unit conducts its motion and fire are strongly 
influenced by the construction of the unit.

Building a Unit
The units used in Bots and Auto are built according to the tastes of the 
player running them.  A unit has six armor facings protecting its internal 
systems from damage.  Armor is ablative; each point of damage reduces 
the amount of armor by one.  Once a given armor facing is reduced to 
zero, all remaining damage is applied to the internal systems.  There are a 
number of internal systems to protect: life support, control, chassis, 
reactor, batteries, hardpoints, weapons, and ammunition.  Each has a 
cost and weight associated with it, forcing economic compromises to be 
made to build a unit to meet a given cost.  The mobility of a unit is based 
on the amount of power available and the current mass of the unit, both of 
which can change in play.  

Weapons
There are a variety of weapons systems available, each with different 
characteristics.  Weapons that require ammunition usually need little 
power while power-based weapons require much more.  The lasers are 
relatively light in mass, short-range, and power hungry.  Mortars have a 
minimum range and require heavy ammunition, but they also have a long 
maximum range and do not require line of sight to fire.  Autocannon inflict 
moderate damage to moderate ranges, but they too, require a large 
amount of moderately heavy ammunition.  Miniguns are lighter, smaller, 
short-range versions of the autocannon.  Missiles have varying ranges 
and warheads, but they can be shot down by point defenses, and they too, 
are heavy.  Particle beam weapons are highly effective in a narrowly 
focused range.  Aside from mortars, missiles, and particle beams, most 
weapons improve as range shortens.

The non-offensive weapons systems are stealth, missile defense, and 
hardpoints.  Stealth, which is expensive,  allows a unit to approach others 
and remain unseen.  Missile defense attempts to shoot down incoming 
missiles.

Hardpoints are mounts for optional, single-shot items.  The most common 
hardpoint load is a jump pack.  Jump packs allow a unit to jump over 
obstacles such as water.  They increase the mobility of a unit greatly but 
can only be used once.  The other common hardpoint load is an anti-
aircraft missile.

Play Balance (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
The selection of a weapon determines much about the unit.  Units with 
long-range weapons usually require heavy ammunition.  Their great 
weight means limited mobility.  Limited mobility implies an inability to 
escape from units with high mobility and short-range weapons.  It is 
axiomatic that short-range weapons require high mobility.  Therefore, 
short-range weapons must be light to be effective.  These trade-offs are 
required for play balance among a wide diversity of systems.  Mortar 
units, for example, were popular on teams but few people actually wanted 
to play them.

To be successful in play, a unit must maneuver effectively, fire its 
weapons, and evade enemy fire.  It should distribute enemy fire across 
multiple armor facings.  If team mates are present, a unit should 
coordinate fire among the team members to combine fire against single 
enemy units.  If a unit takes damage, it should flee until it is repaired.  The 
richness of detail in the Bots family of games is comparable to that of Star 
Fleet BattlesTM.

Auto units are not allowed to cheat, so the behavior code cannot access 
information that a human player in the same situation would not have.  The 
advantage of access to hidden data was considered at first, but has 
proven to be unnecessary.  No Auto program was written for Aero units.  
The success of Auto units on the ground removed all demand for an Auto 
equivalent to Aero.

The Original Algorithm
The original algorithm for Autos was quite simple.  The closest enemy unit 
was selected as the target.  All other units were ignored.  The Auto turned 
to face the enemy and attempted to close.  (See Figure 1)  After 
maneuvers were complete, the unit attempted to fire its weapons.  The fire 
target was the closest enemy within the arc of the weapons fire.  The unit 
would not flee if damaged.  The unit would not jump unless blocked by 
water, buildings, or steep slopes.  

Spreading Out Damage
There were many failures with the original algorithm.  Foremost among 
these was the propensity for the unit to lose its center forward armor and 
take severe internal damage while the left and right forward armor facings 
were pristine.  The solution to this problem was for the unit to shorten the 
amount it moved to save sufficient mobility to rotate after its motion.  (See 
Figure 2)  This rotation would bring the strongest forward armor to face 
the closest enemy unit.  Relative bearing and the integer values of the 
forward armor were the parameters that enabled this change, which 
typically tripled the survival of all units.  It especially allowed units with 
short-range weapons to close to their effective ranges.  This algorithm 
became known as the basic closure code.


Self Assessment
The modified algorithm still had major problems.  During a long closure, a 
unit would loose all three forward armor facings, continue closing, and 
take fatal internals.  The fix involved self assessment.  Before a unit 
started maneuvers, it would evaluate the state of its forward armor, 
internal systems, and ammunition.  If all three forward armor facings were 
below minimum, half of any internal system was destroyed, or if 
ammunition was gone, then the unit would declare itself to be unfit for 
battle and flee.  It would turn its strongest rear armor toward the closest 
enemy and move as far away as possible.  This is just a slightly modified 
version of the basic closure code.  If the unit had a jump pack available, it 
would jump as far away as possible.  It would choose not to shoot power 
based weapons to save energy for mobility.  The parameters for this 
change were simple integer numbers: armor, systems, and ammunition 
counts.  This change increased the long term survivability of the Auto 
units greatly.  After it, destroying a unit often required a long chase.  In 
rolling terrain, enemy units would simply disappear when they were 
seriously damaged.  

Battle Range
At this point, Auto units were interesting but not threatening.  Their 
maneuvers were highly predictable.  At point blank range a unit would 
close to zero range and stop.  Since all motion in Bots is simultaneous, 
human players would simply move forward and turn around, finding 
themselves at near zero range facing the back of the Auto unit.  Fatal 
internals for the Auto unit often soon followed.  For long-range units such 
as mortars, and specific range units such as particle beam weapons,  
continuos closure was especially counter-productive.  Mortar units have a 
minimum range requirement, and care very little about range otherwise.  
In the laser family, where closure improves damage, closure also gives 
the advantage to the lightest and shortest ranged lasers.  The fix was to 
establish a battle range (known as BRG) for each weapon type.  The 
parameter used with BRG was range.

BRG numbers were tuned during play.  While many weapons benefit from 
close range, BRG was picked to balance survivability and the ability to 
inflict damage.  Long-range units would prefer to stay at range, denying 
short-range units any fire.  If a unit found itself too close, it would back up 
as much as it could.  Yet backing up costs twice as much as forward 
motion.  BRG helped to keep the long-range support units out of trouble, 
and it helped all units survive combat with a short-range unit.  Short-range 
units were still too predictable and easy for human players to destroy.  
BRG was the evolutionary step that set the stage for a major milestone in 
Auto evolution.

The First Major Milestone Change: New Maneuver Code
The problem with the maneuver code was predictability.  The new 
maneuver code dealt with the answers to two questions:  "Where can a 
unit go?"  and  "Where does a unit want to go?"  The first question is 
answered by computing the mobility of a unit, which is based on its power 
and mass.  The unit can get to roughly any point within a circle, centered 
on the unit, of radius equal to the mobility of the unit.  When computing the 
radius of the mobility circle, sufficient mobility is deducted from the radius 
to provide for turns.  The second question is answered by BRG.  If the 
target does not move, the most effective place to be is some place on a 
circle, centered on the target, of radius BRG.  (See Figure 3)  If the two 
circles do not intersect, the existing basic closure code is used.  If the 
circles intersect, there are three possibilities.

The first possibility is shown in Figure 4.  This is the most dangerous case 
for the target, and the best case for the attacker.  This situation is most 
often seen when a high mobility unit carrying short ranged weapons 
attacks.  The unit will pick a random point on the BRG circle, move to it, 
and turn to face the target.  For the target to evade, it must either move far 
enough to get out of range, or it must move behind the random point on the 
BRG circle where the attacker will appear.  Neither of these evasions is 
easy.  The first requires good mobility, and the second requires good luck.  
If the target does move far enough away to deny weapons fire, the 
attacker will have more power available to move in the next turn.  

The second possibility is shown in Figure 5.  This is a good case for any 
attacker.  This situation is most often seen when a medium or high 
mobility unit carrying medium-range weapons attacks.  The unit randomly 
picks one of the two intersection points, moves to it, and turns to face the 
target.  Only a target with more mobility than the attacker will be able to 
out maneuver the attacker.  As Figure 5 moves toward Figure 4, the 
attacker becomes nearly impossible to evade.  

The third case is shown in Figure 6.  The mobility circle is inside the BRG 
circle, which means that the attacker is too close.  This is usually the 
case when a low mobility unit carrying long-range weapons is closer than 
desired to  an enemy unit.  Here the unit determines if it would get farther 
away by backing up, or by turning away, moving forward, and turning again 
to face the target.  It chooses the way that takes it farthest away and 
executes that maneuver.

BRG and computed mobility, the parameters of the change, are combined 
in an effective algorithm.  The effect of the first milestone change was 
dramatic.  Attacking units were much more effective (fleeing units were 
unaffected).  Human players could no longer destroy Auto units without 
pause.  Close combat maneuvers became very dicey.  Novice players had 
less than a 50% chance of winning a one-on-one duel.  In single combat, 
Auto units played a solid, if uninspired, game and they never made stupid 
errors.  

Initial Team Play: Communications
The team play of Autos still lacked a great deal - they fought as a mob, 
rather than as a team.  Any unit that could see no targets would pick a 
random patrol point on the map and head toward it.  This scattering 
behavior was good for finding hidden enemy units, but poor for fighting 
enemy teams.  If one unit on a team was engaged, the rest of the team 
would ignore the combat unless they too could see the target.  Evolution 
continued, as Auto units learned basic communications skills.  A unit that 
could see no targets would ask its team for targeting information.  The 
other units (Aero, Auto, and Bots) on the same team would reply with the 
map coordinates of the targets that they could see.  These coordinates 
could be used the next turn to plot motion.  Units that did not require line-
of-sight to fire, such as mortars, would fire blindly on the map coordinates 
given.  The effects of this change were two-fold.  It allowed high mobility 
units carrying short-ranged weapons to close upon enemy units that they 
could not see.  This meant that once an enemy unit was spotted, all 
unoccupied Autos would head toward it, even in rolling terrain.  The 
second effect provided mortar teams with something productive to do.  
Communicating map coordinates proved to be an effective change.  To 
the enemy units, it meant to expect mortar fire whenever spotted by any 
member of the Auto team.  A particularly nasty combination was to be 
stalked by an unseen stealth unit that was broadcasting coordinates to its 
mortar teammates.  This change tended to keep mobs of Autos together, 
but they still fought as a mob.

The Second Major Milestone Change: Improved Team Play
Targeting was still based on the closest enemy that could be fired at.  In 
team play, a lone unit could distract part of a team of Autos and play Pied 
Piper while the rest of the Piper's team destroyed the other part of the 
Auto team.  The Piper might not survive, but while it was being destroyed, 
multiple enemy units would be destroyed, tipping the battle against the 
Autos.  The second milestone change increased team play.  Team play 
was based on the concept of the team target.  The enemy unit that 
appeared to be hurt the most would be designated as team target.  This 
designation was based on the volume of fire an enemy had absorbed.  The 
team target would always be the preferred target for motion control.  If the 
team target was between the minimum and maximum effective range for 
the weapons fired, it would be the preferred target for fire as well.  The 
results were often devastating and occasionally quite strange.  The 
devastating part stemmed from the fact that a single unit, often already 
damaged, could now take all the mortar, long-range missile, autocannon, 
and much of the short-range laser fire that an entire team could inflict.  
The strange part would happen when an Auto unit would move directly 
past and ignore a closer target in order to help destroy the team target.  
But if the team target were not a viable target, each unit would fire as 
before, usually at the closest target.

Mishaps in team play were now fatal.  Teams of experts were now doing 
well to achieve a kill ratio of 2.5:1 in favor of the experts.  Novice teams 
required two to five times numerical superiority to win.  The parameters 
used had been developed in earlier stages of evolution.

Attack Jumps
Evolution continued as details were refined to solve minor problems.  One 
problem was that Autos would only use a jump pack to flee or to cross 
water.  This meant that they would often have an unused jump pack at 
reload time, when a new jump pack would be available.  The fix was 
simple; units still carrying a jump pack that were near their reload time 
would be free to jump to increase their mobility.  The parameter used was 
the unit's turn counter, which already existed.  This change made it 
dangerous to rely on predictions about the mobility of an Auto unit.  A fast 
moving unit that had been moving four ranges per turn would suddenly 
jump eight and move four more for a total of twelve ranges of motion when 
only four were expected.

Dealing With Aeros
The final changes involved dealing with Aeros.  Bots and Autos usually 
move one to four ranges per turn.  Aeros need to move at least ten to 
retain airspeed, and speeds of twenty to fifty are normal.  Normal altitudes 
for Aeros typically run from eight to twenty ranges of altitude.  The first 
problem Aeros created was that Autos would attempt to set up motion 
based on an Aero target.  Since the motion algorithms are optimized for 
non-moving targets, using an Aero to set up motion was ineffective for 
units with a short BRG.  It was ineffective for units with a long BRG if the 
Aero was close by, since the bearing of the Aero would change 
dramatically.  Even if perfect predictive algorithms were available, only 
units with a long BRG have sufficient range to hurt Aeros at altitude.  The 
important changes were range based.  All units that had a BRG of 25 or 
higher would prefer any visible enemy Aero to all other targets for fire and 
motion.  Units with lower BRG would ignore Aeros when plotting motion, 
but if an Aero was somehow in acceptable range, it would be the preferred 
fire target.  At reload time, Autos remembered if they had seen any Aeros 
since last reload and changed their hardpoint weapons mix to prefer anti-
aircraft missiles.  The changes decreased the survivability of Aeros 
greatly.  Aero targets were preferred even to team targets, often with the 
same deadly results.  The much-maligned mortar units provided greatly 
needed flak fire.  Other less popular long BRG units gained a new role.  
Also, the advent of the stealth anti-aircraft missile battery eased the 
problems ground units had with Aeros.

Future Evolution
There are still several deficiencies with the Auto program.  Complex 
terrain tends to mystify Autos, especially urban terrain and bridges.  An 
Auto unit will occasionally present weak or down armor toward one enemy 
while fighting another.  This single mindedness also shows up when a 
damaged unit flees.  Motion directly away from the closest enemy, which 
is always correct in one-on-one, can be fatal when intermixed with an 
enemy team.

Observations About The Process
Many observations are worth examining.  The first of these is that the 
process of analysis and synthesis is regenerative.  The initial BRG 
change set the stage for the first milestone change (maneuver code).  
BRG also led to min/max range, which when coupled with 
communications led to the second milestone change (team play).  Some 
of the other analysis that went on made it possible and more probable that 
algorithms could be generated to improve poor behavior.

Not as obvious in the paper is the fact that intensive testing helps drive 
the process.  The entire evolutionary cycle mentioned above took place at 
lunchtimes over the course of a year.  The testing allowed the author to 
observe human behavior in order to model it, and it clearly showed any 
deficiencies in the algorithms.

One very hopeful point is that simple methods often suffice.  The long 
closure code and the code for flight is simple but has proven to be very 
effective.  The early code, which had numerous deficiencies, was still 
interesting and fun.  Between the first and second milestone changes, 
there was, occasionally, the semblance of team behavior by default.  If a 
given enemy unit was the best or only target available to a team, the entire 
team fired upon it.  In rolling terrain this would be fatal as one unit 
encountered groups of enemy units.

A final point is that the code is well behaved.  It is small, runs rapidly, and 
is easy to follow.  The behavior control parts of the code do not require 
any extensive calculations.  The code is short, with only two files.  In fact, 
the Auto program has less source and a smaller executable than the Bots 
program.  The increase in size from automation is more than offset by the 
reduction in size gained by deleting the user interface.  The control flow of 
the code is relatively easy to follow, and therefore easy to modify.


Conclusions:
The evolutionary method is a viable alternative to exploring AI 
methodologies.  The method is universally available to programmers who 
have sufficient time for repeated testing.  It is well suited to game 
programs in which the computer and human players deal with the same 
objects and information - - the programmer can model computer behavior 
on successful human behavior.  The method fails when the programmer 
cannot identify the keys to changing poor behavior and the default simple 
methods are ineffective.  For the multiplayer, tactical combat games that 
this author has written, the methods have produced effective code that is 
fast, compact, and often pleasingly simple.
