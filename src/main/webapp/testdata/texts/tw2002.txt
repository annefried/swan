     You peer out the window of your private quarters onto the
     vast unknown.  You ponder the possibilities of expanding
     your one-ship trading company.  You've become comfortable
     with your regular route; the familiar ports, the familiar
     traders, no hassles, no dangers.  Maybe you've become too
     comfortable.  Lately you've been hearing a nagging voice
     in the back of your mind urging you to be more, do more
     and experience more.  You feel there has to be more to
     life than this easy, peaceful yet unfulfilling existence
     your life has become.  

     You put your feet up, sip your drink and resolve to
     become the best trader the universe will allow you to be.




Trade Wars 2002 combines adventure and exploration with strategy
and cooperative play in an entertaining and exciting on-line game. 
You compete against other BBSers to be the most powerful trader (or
corporation of traders) in the universe.  Independent traders can
compete quite effectively against large corporations.  Corporate
members can perform specific duties (as directed by their C.E.O.)
in specialized ships.  Traders can be "good guys" or "bad guys"
with different avenues for advancement.  The universe can be
different with each new game.  There is no right or wrong way to
play and the possible strategies are limited only by one's
imagination.


PLAYING THE GAME

When you enter the game, you will be piloting a Merchant Cruiser. 
This is considered the most versatile ship in the Trade Wars
armada.  In it, new players have a chance to try out all aspects of
the game.

Upon entering, you will be asked what alias you would like to use
in the game and what name you would like to christen your ship. 
The alias you choose will display in the player and corporate
rankings and in several corporate listings.  Your ship name will be
used in the docking logs at the ports.  You can use these names to
be as conspicuous or as inconspicuous as you want.

The equipment in your initial ship will include 20 holds to store
the cargo that you can trade at the ports found throughout the
universe.  Trading is the basic way to advance in the game.  By
good trading, you can gain experience as well as gain credits.  The
credits you earn can fund your military and can provide the capital
you will need to expand your trading expeditions.

The game will differ with each different group of players. 
Individual traders are ranked by their experience.  You gain
experience simply by playing the game.  The more things you do, the
more experience you will get.  Good and Evil are represented by the
titles each player receives.  Your experience combined with your
alignment will determine whether you are a Lieutenant or a Dread
Pirate.  When you do something that affects your alignment, you
will get a message saying your alignment went up or down and by how
much.  

There are benefits and drawbacks whether you choose to play the
game as a good trader or an evil trader.  Traders who follow the
FedLaws are offered protection in FedSpace until they are
experienced enough to protect themselves.  Traders who aspire to be
very good can be awarded a Federal Commission.  This allows them to
purchase an Imperial Starship.  This is one of the most powerful
ships in the universe.  On the other hand, the evil traders are
offered some options in the Underground.  Traders who have proved
that they are truly evil can steal product or money from the ports.

THE UNIVERSE

You will be traveling in a 1000 sector universe.  Sectors may have
planets, ports, other players, aliens, Ferrengi, Federation
Starships, mines, message beacons, fighters (belonging to you,
other players, rogue mercenaries, or the Ferrengi) or the sectors
may contain nothing at all.  If in your travels you come across
something undesirable, your initial ship comes equipped with 30
fighters with which you can defend yourself.

Many players find it useful to have a home sector or group of
sectors.  Players, especially those just joining a game, need an
out-of-the-way place to stay so they can build up their assets. 
You can explore the universe and look for dead end sectors to use
as a hiding place.  Corporate bases built in traffic lanes don't
fare too well and those in the major thoroughfares (in the paths
between the class 0 and class 9 ports) just don't stand much of a
chance.  

Planets play a key part in your success as a trader.  Terra, the
first planet you encounter as you enter the game, is where the
people can be found to colonize all other planets.  The other
planets in the game will, if inhabited, produce Fuel Ore, Organics,
Equipment and Fighters.  You and the other traders decide where the
planets will be.  You can purchase a Genesis Torpedo and use it in
almost any sector in the galaxy.  If the planet has enough of the
required commodities and enough people to supply the labor to build
it, you can begin construction of a Citadel.  The Citadel can
provide you and the other members of your corporation with a secure
place to dock your ships and deposit the credits you've earned.  As
you progress in the game, your Citadel can be upgraded to provide
additional protection to you and your corporation.  If you decide
to build a planet in your home sector, be sure you can defend it. 
A planets is very vulnerable until it has a Combat Control Computer
(level 2 Citadel) to safeguard it.

There are ten different types of ports scattered about the
universe.  The ports are classified by the products they buy and/or
sell.  Port classes 1 through 8 trade the three basic commodities:
Fuel Ore, Organics and Equipment.  The universe also contains
specialty ports for the other items you will need to advance in the
game.  There are three Class 0 ports where you can purchase holds
(beneficial for moving colonists to your planets as well as
transporting goods for trade), fighters (to help protect your
territory), or shields (to protect your ship from the traps laid by
your enemies).  There is one Class 9 port that contains not only a
Trading Port, but also a StarDock.  The StarDock houses the Stellar
Hardware Emporium, the Federation Shipyards, the Lost Trader's
Tavern, the 2nd National Galactic Bank, the Videon Cineplex and the
Interstellar Space Police Headquarters.  There are other places of
interest located in the StarDock.  These places you will have to
discover on your own.  Some are not advertised because they are
establishments of questionable repute.  Others are Federation
buildings that house top secret government information.
 

PEOPLE IN THE TRADE WARS UNIVERSE

A large part of playing is interacting with others in the game. 
You can mingle with other players in the Lost Traders Tavern,
gambling against them, conversing with them, leaving announcements
at the door or writing a message on the bathroom wall.  You can
combine your assets with other players of the same alignment to
form a Corporation.  Just be aware that more than one Corporation
has been brought down by a con man who wormed his way into the
Corporate structure.  You can have a chance encounter with other
creatures of the universe, both real (other users) and Non-Player
Characters (the Federals, Alien traders and the Ferrengi).  Chance
encounters offer many possibilities and can advance you in your
chosen career path.  Your alignment and experience and the
alignment and experience of the creature you encounter will
determine just how that advancement if affected.

Other traders are users just like you.  They have alignment and
experience points.  You can see all the others by Listing Traders
from your ships computer.  By using the listing, you can see which
players are good and which are evil.  You can estimate whether the
other player would better serve your needs as an ally or adversary.

The Federation is the main governing body of the cosmos.  You will
meet the Feds if you go to the Police Station.  You might run into
them as you roam around space.  The Feds don't look kindly on
players who break FedLaws, so if you're not careful, they might
visit you when you least want their company.

Alien traders are visitors from another universe who are looking
for better ports.  You can get a listing of the Aliens similar to
the one you get for other traders.  Aliens also have experience and
alignment, but you cannot form a Corporation with them.  

The Ferrengi are a greedy, cowardly group.  Their primary purpose
is the speedy acquisition of money.  They will steal from anyone no
matter what the person's or corporation's alignment.  They seldom
engage in face-to-face combat because they prefer the advantage of
surprise when ambushing their opponent.  They often travel in
groups and will spy on promising territory.  After targeting an
area, they will raid the sector when it is least defended.  If they
are attacked, that group will hold a grudge against the attacker
and they will not rest until they feel the score has been settled.

Explore the universe and take part in the adventure.  You can just
look around or you can become a dominant factor.  Most of the
displays are fully explained.  When you are asked to make a
selection, anything displayed in brackets [], will be the default. 
Most displays can be aborted by hitting the space bar.

Good Trading and Good Luck.


                          MENU OPTIONS

MAIN MENU

Navigation

<D>  Re-display Sector.  This will re-display the information
     about the sector where you are currently located. 
     Information includes sector number and nebulae name,
     marker beacons, port name and class, mines, fighters,
     planets and any other ships.

<P>  Port and Trade.  This will allow you to dock at the port
     in your current sector.  This is the only way to trade
     your commodities.  You will have some choices for what
     action you would like to take at the port.  Most of the
     choices are self-explanatory.  When you dock at the port,
     you will be able to see the docking log.  This will show
     you the name of the last ship to do business there.  If
     there is a planet in the sector with this port, you will
     be able to negotiate a Planetary Trade Agreement.  This
     is a trade contract that will allow you to trade off all
     your excess commodities to the port without wasting your
     turns hauling one shipload at a time.  If you want to
     build a new Starport and the universe is full or if you
     decide that your adversaries have too big an advantage
     and you need to get rid of that port they have been
     using, you can attack and destroy a starport.  This is
     never an easy task.  The starports are very heavily armed
     and will retaliate, so you will need to have plenty of
     military forces with you if you decide to proceed with
     this selection.

<M>  Move to a Sector.  The sectors adjacent to your current
     location will be listed as warp lanes in the sector
     display.  You can move to one of them, or you can choose
     any other sector in the universe.  If you designate a
     sector that doesn't have a direct warp lane, your ship's
     computer will plot your course and ask you if you want to
     engage your AutoPilot.  You will be able to use the
     Autopilot in three different modes.  The default is Alert
     mode.  This will suspend your travel in any sector where
     there is a planet, port or other trader.  The second mode
     is Express.  This speeds you to your destination provided
     there are no enemy forces in your path.  The third mode
     is Single Step.  This was developed by an enterprising
     group of pioneers.  Their group was getting smaller due
     to bold exploration of sectors filled with mines, so the
     survivors manufactured an Autopilot that would stop in
     each sector.  This allowed them to scan the next sector
     for hazards before proceeding into it.  Select this
     option if you feel the need for caution.  To move through
     the AutoPilot course after choosing this option, you will
     need to select M, then re-confirm your destination and
     mode.

<L>  Land on a Planet.  This option will enable you to
     colonize your planets, build a Citadel and do business
     there, pick up the fighters built by your colonists or
     pick up the production of Fuel Ore, Organics and/or
     Equipment.  If you have purchased a Planet Scanner at the
     Hardware Emporium, it will automatically provide you with
     additional information about the planet.  The Planet
     Scanner will also allow you to abort the landing
     procedure if, after looking at the defenses, you feel you
     may not be able to land successfully.

<S>  Long Range Scan.  If you have purchased a scanner from
     the Hardware Emporium, you can use it to view adjacent
     sectors.  All things in the Trade Wars universe have a
     density value and you can use your Density Scanner to
     display the relative density of the neighboring sectors. 
     You can then use that information to determine what's
     next door.  If you have a Holographic Scanner, you will
     be able to see ports, planets, hazards and other players
     all for just the cost of one turn.

<R>  Release Beacon.  Choose this when you want to launch one
     of the Marker Beacons you purchased at the Hardware
     Emporium.  You will need to decide what message your
     beacon will send when you launch it.

<W>  Tow SpaceCraft.  This option lets you toggle your tractor
     beam on and off.  The computer will ask you which trader
     in your current sector you wish to tow.  The computer
     will then calculate (using the size difference between
     the two ships) the number of turns you will use for each
     sector you tow this trader and his/her ship.  You can
     then use the Move option to go to an adjacent sector or
     you can engage your AutoPilot to move you and your
     "passenger".  TransWarp drives were not made to be used
     in conjunction with tractor beams, so if you use your
     TransWarp, the tractor beam will automatically shut down. 
     The person you are towing will not enter a sector until
     you have safely entered.  The tractor beam will act as a
     protective shield and will safeguard the towee from any
     damage from mines, offensive fighters or Quasar cannons. 
     If your ship is destroyed, the tractor beam will also be
     destroyed and the person you are towing will be left
     stranded.  To disengage the beam at any point, use this
     option again.                       
                                            
Computer and Information

<C>  Engage Crai XXV.  This command will activate your on-
     board computer.

<I>  Ship Info.  This will display all your current
     statistics.  
          Trader Name......Your alias in the game
          Rank and Exp.....The number of experience points you have
                           accumulated, the number of alignment  
                           points you have accumulated and the
                           title you have received
          Times Blown Up...The number of times your ship has been
                           destroyed
          Ship Name........The name of the ship you are now using
          Ship Info........Manufacturer and model
                           Ported = The number of times this ship
                           has docked at a Trading Port
                           Kills = Number of other player's ships
                           destroyed by this ship
          Date Built.......The date this ship was purchased
          Current Sector...Your current location
          Turns Left.......Number of turns remaining for this ship
          Total Holds......Number of holds this ship is carrying
                           (This display also shows the breakdown
                            of the cargo in the holds)
     Additional information includes all the special equipment
     your ship has and the number of credits you have on your
     ship.

<T>  Corporate Menu.  This will give you information about all
     the corporations in the game.

<U>  Use Genesis Torpedo.  If you are carrying a Genesis
     Torpedo, you will be able to detonate it using this
     command.  Have your planet name ready because these will
     create your new world quickly.

<J>  Jettison Cargo.  If your holds are full of some cargo you
     just can't unload on any nearby port or planet, you may
     use this selection to unceremoniously dump your holds
     into space.  Remember that FedLaw prohibits littering in
     FedSpace.  Dumping holds filled with colonists will leave
     a negative impression on your alignment.
                                                                 
Tactical

<A>  Attack Enemy Spacecraft.  When you encounter an opponent
     (or other creature) in a sector you have the option of
     going on the offense and attacking.  The controller will
     ask you how many of your fighters you want to use in the
     attack.  Attacking others can (and probably will) affect
     your alignment.  If you attack a pirate or known terror
     you will get good points.  On the other hand, if you
     decide to pick on some good soul you will go down the
     ladder of righteousness.

<E>  Ethereal Probe.  Launch the Probe you purchased at the
     Hardware Emporium.  Send the unmanned spy off to its
     destination sending information back to you from every
     sector it passes through.  Remember that this device has
     no defensive capabilities so if it encounters any enemy
     fighters, it will be destroyed.

<F>  Take or Leave Fighters.  This enables you to deploy your
     fighters.  You will have several options so you can
     customize your defenses.  You can leave fighters as
     either Personal so they recognize only you as an ally or
     you can leave them as Corporate so any member of your
     corporation will be treated with respect.  Fighters can
     be Offensive, Defensive or Toll.  Defensive fighters
     defend your territory.  They bar opponents from entering
     a sector and will fight when attacked.  Offensive
     fighters will send out an attack group on any poor soul
     who happens into their sector.  The size of the attack
     group depends on the fighter support escorting the
     intruder.  After the initial attack, offensive fighters
     fall back to defend their territory.  Toll fighters
     simply stop the casual passers-by and ask them for money
     to help with your cause.  The number of Toll Fighters
     deployed will determine the amount of the toll charged. 
     Toll fighters, as all other fighters, will fight back if
     attacked.

<G>  Show Deployed Fighters.  This display can be a very
     useful tool as you plan your military strategies.  The
     information shown contains the sector number where the
     fighters are located, the quantity of fighters there,
     whether the fighters are Personal or Corporate, the
     strategic mode they are in (Offensive, Defensive or Toll)
     and any tolls they have collected.

<H>  Handle Space Mines.  Mines can be a very convincing way
     of marking your territory.  This selection will let you
     place or pick up the mines.  You will be able to choose
     whether to set the mines as Personal or Corporate. 
     Personal mines will recognize only you and Corporate
     mines will recognize any member of your corporation. 
     Mines don't always go off, but it stands to reason that
     the more mines there are in a sector, the more likely one
     is to detonate.

<K>  Show Deployed Mines.  This display is similar to the Show
     Deployed Fighters.  You get information about the sectors
     containing your Personal and/or Corporate mines and how
     many mines are located in each of those sectors.

<O>  Starport Construction.  If there is not a Starport in the
     sector, this menu selection will display the Starport
     Construction Menu.  Starports are available throughout
     the universe.  You may decide that you want your own
     customized commerce center in a place you specify instead
     of using the ones built by others.  You will see a
     detailed graph of the different port classes, the
     products they can import/export and the initial
     construction costs.  The license bureau will check to see
     that there is a planet in the sector to provide materials
     for the construction.  They will also check for
     sufficient funding to support the undertaking.  Be sure
     to leave the specified amount of materials on the planet
     every day during the construction phase or the building
     will not progress.  If there is already a Starport in the
     sector, the Upgrade Starport Menu will be displayed. 
     This allows you to increase the trading levels of any or
     all of the commodities.  The universe can support only so
     many ports.  If the Starport Construction request tells
     you that the universe is full, then you have to destroy
     an existing port before you can begin construction on
     your new one.  (See PORT AND TRADE)

<V>  View Game Status.  Trade Wars 2002 can be configured in
     a variety of ways by your SysOp.  This display will show
     you the static information about the game as well as the
     current information.  Static information includes the
     version number, maximum number of sector, players, etc.,
     whether or not the local display is on, and if this is a
     registered version of the game.  The StarDock location
     may also appear on this screen (SysOp option).  The
     current information will show how many players are now in
     the game with the percentage of good, how many planets
     have been built, how many corporations are registered,
     the amount of credits accumulated at the ports, the total
     fighters and mines in the universe and how long the game
     has been running.

                                                                 
AUTOPILOT MENU

<Y>  Yes, stop here.  This will disengage the Autopilot and
     will stop you in the current sector.

<N>  No, continue on.  Continues on the pre-defined route.

<E>  Express Non-stop.  This will speed you through the
     sectors without pausing to ask if you want to stop in the
     sectors with planets or ports.  Hitting the space bar
     while in Express mode will put you into warp speed.  If
     you encounter enemy forces you will have to react.  If
     you retreat, the computer will re-plot your course
     avoiding that sector from which you retreated.

     statistics.  The display is the same as option <I> from
     the Main Menu.

<R>  Port Report.  This will display the port report
     information as if you chose <R> from your on-board
     computer.

<S>  Long Range Scan.  If you have purchased a Long Range
     Scanner from the Hardware Emporium, you can use it during
     your AutoPilot voyage without having to stop in the
     sector.  

<D>  Re-Display Sector.  This is the same sector display that
     can be accessed by choosing option <D> from the Main
     Menu.

<P>  Port and Trade.  This will allow you to dock at a Trading
     Port and conduct your business without having to
     recalculate your Autopilot course when you're done.  You
     will be selecting the same options as you would if you
     chose the <P> selection from the Main Menu.

<!>  Autopilot Help.  Displays this file.


COMPUTER MENU

Navigation

<F>  Course Plotter.  This will show the number of moves it
     will take to get from any sector in the universe to
     another.  You can use this tool to avoid any surprise as
     you travel between sectors.  You know the universe is
     full of unexplained phenomenon and just because you got
     from your home sector to this sector with a great port in
     five moves doesn't mean you'll get back in five moves.

<I>  Inter-Sector Warps.  This selection will show you the
     warps lanes connected to any sector in the universe that
     you have explored.  You just enter the sector number and
     the computer will show you every sector directly linked
     to that sector.  The computer will not have data to
     display for those sectors you have yet to explore.

<K>  Your Known Universe.  As you travel through space, you
     will be creating your personal travelogue.  This will
     store information about the sectors you've explored. 
     Your computer will use this information to give you your
     Port Reports and Inter-Sector Warps.  You may wish to see
     what sectors you have (or don't have) in your travelogue. 
     This option will tell you.  You will see what percentage
     of the universe you have visited and the computer will
     ask if you want the list of Explored or Unexplored
     sectors.  When you reply, you will get a list of sector
     numbers.

<R>  Port Report.  This report gives you relatively up-to-date
     information about any port located in a sector which you
     have explored.  All you have to do is enter the sector
     number in which the port is located.  You will see items
     being traded at the port, the status of each of those
     items (whether the port is buying them or selling them),
     the number of units the port is willing to trade (and
     what percentage of maximum that number represents) and
     how many of each of the commodities you have in your
     holds.  If for some reason you get the message that the
     computer has no information on that port and you are sure
     there is a port in the sector you indicated, there may be
     enemy forces in that sector interfering with your
     computer's scan.

<V>  Avoid Sectors.  You will sometimes find sectors
     containing things that are detrimental to your success in
     the game.  This function will avoid those sectors when
     doing any course plotting.  You just have to enter the
     sector or sectors to be by-passed before you use the
     computer to plot a course or to establish a route for
     your AutoPilot.  If the computer encounters a situation
     where there is not possible route between the sectors you
     requested, then all voids will be cleared and will have
     to be re-entered before any future course calculations.

<W>  Use Mine Disrupter.  You are exploring a new region of
     the universe and as you single-step your way along, your
     scanner shows a number of mines in the next sector.  Send
     one of the Mine Disrupters you purchased at the Hardware
     Emporium into this mined sector so you don't have to take
     the damage to your ship.  If the first Disrupter doesn't
     disarm all the mines, you can send in another.

<X>  List Current Avoids.  When you want to see just what
     sectors are being avoided when the computer charts your
     course, use this selection.  You can use this information
     to determine if you want to make any changes.  Due to the
     limited functionality of this module of the computer, if
     you want to remove one or more avoided sectors from the
     list, you must clear the entire list and re-enter the
     sector numbers you still want to bypass.   

<P>  Fire Photon Missile.  You can fire your Photon Missile
     into the adjacent sector and run in to do your damage. 
     Remember that the timer is running as soon as the missile
     is launched so be quick!

<B>  Begin Self-destruct Sequence.  If you have managed to
     make a real mess of things and the only way to continue
     is to start from scratch, then go ahead and use this
     command.  You will escape from your ship moments before
     it self-destructs.  Think it over carefully before you
     hit the button.  This will not only destroy your ship and
     all its inventory, but it will also affect your rank and
     alignment.  Your spirit takes two days to migrate back to
     Sector 1, so you won't have any turns the day after you
     self-destruct.

Miscellaneous

<A>  Make Announcement.  Do you have something you want to
     tell everyone in the game?  If so, prepare your
     proclamation and enter it.  You will have 160 characters
     for your announcement and it will be displayed in the
     Daily Log for everyone to read as they enter the game.

<C>  View Ship Catalog.  This tool lets you view the
     specifications for all the available ships in the game. 
     You can get a list of the ships and choose which ever one
     strikes your fancy.  The display will show the following
     information - 

               Basic Hold Cost
               Main Drive Cost
               Computer Cost
               Ship Hull Cost
               Base Cost
               Minimum and Maximum Holds
               Maximum Fighters
               Maximum Shields
               Number of Moves per Day
               Maximum Number of Mines
               Maximum Number of Genesis Torpedoes
               Offensive Odds for Combat
               Maximum Number of Marker Beacons
               TransWarp Drive Capability
               Long Range Scanner Capability
               Planet Scanner Capability

     In addition to all this information, there is a brief
     narrative about the capabilities and shortcomings of each
     model.

<D>  Read Daily Log.  This will re-display the Daily Journal
     that you see when you enter the game.

<E>  Display Evil Ranks.  This is a display of the titles to
     which you can aspire if you are of negative alignment. 
     It shows the levels, titles and the number of experience
     points needed to attain that level.

<G>  Display Good Ranks.  This is a display of the titles to
     which you can aspire if you are of positive alignment. 
     It shows the levels, titles and the number of experience
     points needed to attain that level.

<H>  List Aliens.  You will encounter traders from other
     galaxies as you make your way through the universe.  You
     can interact with these creatures the same as you do with
     the Traders native to your 1000 sectors.  Of course,
     aliens are either good or bad.  Their alignment (good or
     evil) can make a big difference in how you want to
     associate (or not associate) with them.  When you use
     this selection, your computer will tell you everything
     you need to know.

<L>  List Traders.  This choice will show you all the players
     in the game in order of experience.  Your prompt will ask
     if you would like the list to show the Titles of the
     players or their Values in Experience points.  Each
     trader will be displayed with his or her title or value,
     the number of the Corporation to which he/she belongs,
     and the type of ship currently being used.

<M>  Re-Read Your Mail.  This gives you a chance to review the
     messages that were sent to you since the last time you
     were in the game.

<N>  Toggle ANSI On/Off.  That just about says it all.

<S>  Send Mail.  When you need to get a message to one of the
     other players, this will serve your need.  You will have
     160 characters to get your message through.  You do not
     need to know the player's entire name.  If you have part
     of it, your computer will search the player file and
     prompt you when it finds a match.

<T>  Current Ship Time.  This will display the time and date
     stored in your ship's computer.  (Remember, the game
     began in the year 2002.)

<Y>  List Your Planets.  If you have planets that you want to
     keep as personal, you can view them using this option just
     as you can view Corporate Planets using the <L> option in 
     the Corporation Menu.


PLANET MENU

<A>  Take All Products.  This will load your empty holds with
     the products available on the planet.  The dock workers
     will load your ship to the brim with as much of each of
     the products that is available beginning with the cargo
     of greatest value (Equipment) to the least value (Fuel
     Ore).

<E>  Enter Citadel.  You enter the Citadel (and display the
     Citadel Menu).  If there is no citadel on this planet,
     you will have the option to build one.  The necessary
     products and labor force needed in the construction will
     display.  You will not be issued a building permit if you
     don't have the necessary people and commodities.

<D>  Display Planet.  This will show the planet number, type,
     name and the alias of the player who created it.  There
     is also an informative chart showing how many colonists
     are working in each production area, how many units of
     each product are being produced daily, the quantity of
     each product currently available on the planet, and how
     many of each you have on your ship.  Citadel information
     including level, construction underway and credits in the
     vault is also available.

<M>  Change Military Levels.  You will want to move your
     fighters around to protect your territory.  This option
     will allow you to take fighters currently on the planet
     or to leave fighters you have escorting you.  The
     fighters on the planet are controlled by the Combat
     Control Computer (level 2) in the Citadel.  If there is
     no Combat Control Computer there, the fighters would
     better serve you patrolling the sector outside the
     planet.  Leaving fighters on a planet will designate the
     planet as yours.

<O>  Claim Ownership.  Let the entire universe know who
     controls the planet.  Use this option to set the planet
     as either Personal or Corporate.  This is a must when
     you've gone to all the trouble to capture one of your
     opponent's planets.  

<P>  Change Population Levels.  Throughout the course of the
     game you may wish to change the distribution of your
     workforce among the commodities.  This selection provides
     you with an easy, efficient way to order your workers to
     the job you need done.

<S>  Load/Unload Colonists.  Colonizing your planets can
     contribute greatly to your trading profits.  This will
     enable you to leave the colonists you've brought from
     Terra or pack everyone up and move them to another
     planet.  Keep a close watch on your planet's population
     because many planets experience a growth/death cycle.  If
     your planet has too many people to support, the raw
     materials needed to produce your commodities will be used
     up by the surplus population and your production rates
     will be adversely affected.

<T>  Take or Leave Product.  This will let you specify to the
     dock workers which type of products you want to leave and
     which ones you want loaded on your ship.

<Z>  Try to Destroy Planet.  First you purchase Atomic
     Detonators from the Hardware Emporium.  That is the easy
     part.  You then have to fight your way into the sector
     containing the planet.  After battling the fighters,
     Quasar Cannons, and any other military defenses that may
     be there, you have the ability to lay your Atomic
     Detonators.  Colonists have been trained in the disarming
     of detonators.  Most of the training was rushed and
     provided by inexperienced teachers, so they aren't very
     good at it.  Most of their attempts literally go up in
     smoke, and if you are still on the planet when their
     attempt goes awry, you go awry with it.  You have the
     option of suing your conventional weapons to kill off the
     colonists before you lay the detonators so you don't run
     the risk of getting killed by their lack of skill.  If
     you're willing to risk the bad Karma to be a little
     safer, this might be the correct option for you.

<L>  Leave This Planet.  Take off from the planet.

<!>  Planetary Help.  Display the portion of the documentation
     describing the Planetary functions.


CITADEL MENU 

<C>  Engage Ship's Computer.  Use this function to use all
     your Crai's power just as you would by choosing <C> from
     the Main Menu.

<D>  Display Traders Here.  This will show you the guest
     register of the other players who are parked in the
     Citadel.  The register gives you the name of the player,
     their ship type and how many fighters, shields and holds
     they have.  This information could prove very useful if
     you have just captured the planet from one of your
     opponents.  

<E>  Exchange Trader Ships.  If the other players parked in
     the Citadel have specified their vehicle as available for
     trade, then you have the option of exchanging your ship
     for theirs.  Be sure to coordinate this carefully with
     the other members of your corporation.  Only C.E.O.'s can
     use Corporate Flagships so they are not available for
     trade.  If you have seized this planet from an opponent
     still parked in the Citadel, you may want to commandeer
     his ship for your own use.

<G>  Shield Generator Control.  If you have your level 5
     Citadel completed, you can use this option to store your
     shields.  You transfer your Ship's shields to the
     Planetary Shielding System using this option (10 ship
     shields = 1 planetary shield).  Stored shields will be
     used in the defense of your planet.  The Planetary
     Shielding System will protect your planet from your
     enemies.  You will thwart your rivals' attempts to
     incapacitate your defenses with Photon Missiles.  Your
     opponents will even be unable to scan your planet.

<I>  Personal Info.  This selection will enable you to see all
     of your current statistics.  The information will display
     same as it does when you choose option <I> from the Main
     Menu.

<M>  Military Reaction Level.  Another method of customizing
     your protection, this will let you set the percentage of
     fighters stationed there to be used as offensive or
     defensive in case of an attack on the planet.  You must
     have a Combat Control Computer (Level Two Citadel or
     higher) to use this option.  The value you enter will be
     the percentage of fighters that will attack offensively
     as someone attempts to land on your planet.  The balance
     of your fighters will fall back for defense of the planet
     and Citadel.

<P>  Planetary TransWarp.  The instructions for this feature
     are in your Level Four Citadel.  Provided you have enough
     Fuel Ore to power the mammoth engine, you can move your
     planet to any sector where you currently have fighters
     stationed.

<Q>  Quasar Cannon R-level.  Use this option to set both the
     Atmospheric and Sector reaction levels.  The Quasar
     Cannon in your Level Three Citadel uses massive amounts
     of Fuel Ore.  Use this option to adjust the percentage of
     Ore on the planet used in this weapon's capability. 
     PLEASE NOTE: The Quasar Cannon will use the entered
     percentage of Fuel Ore remaining on the planet for EACH
     SHOT it fires.  If you set the Sector value to 100% and
     a Scout Marauder with 5 fighters wanders into your
     sector, the Cannon will use all the Fuel Ore on your
     planet to blow the intruder into space dust.  If another
     player later tramps into your sector in a well-armed
     BattleShip your Cannon will sit idle due to lack of
     ammunition.  Another consideration when setting your
     percentages is that the accuracy of the Cannon is much
     better and the damage caused by the blast is greater when
     the target is in the planet's atmosphere.

<R>  Remain Here Overnight.  You can sleep feeling safe and
     secure if you bed down inside the Citadel, out of the rat
     race.  You will have the protection of your planetary
     forces to guard you.  When you leave your ship, the valet
     will ask if you want others who enter the Citadel to have
     the privilege of exchanging ships with you.  It's
     perfectly within your rights to keep your ship for
     personal use only.

<S>  Scan This Sector.  This option will let you see
     everything in the sector around this planet.  The display
     will be the same as you get from option <D> in the Main
     Menu.

<T>  Treasury Fund Transfers.  If you don't like to carry a
     lot of credits on you when you're out exploring the
     universe, you can deposit your excess in the Citadel. 
     You can withdraw the credits whenever you need them.  Be
     advised that the Treasury workers are quite lax in their
     security measures and anyone who enters the Citadel can
     withdraw any and all of the credits.

<U>  Upgrade Citadel.  Once your Citadel construction is
     complete, you may find you wish to upgrade.  Very few
     people are content with a Level One Citadel.  You will
     need more colonists and materials for each level of
     improvements.  Level Two has a Combat Control System
     which enables you to set the fighters deployed on the
     planet as offensive or defensive.  Level Three contains
     a Quasar Cannon which is a very powerful weapon, but uses
     a considerable amount of Fuel Ore to operate.  Level Four
     encloses the massive engine used for the TransWarp Drive. 
     Level Five provides the power for the Planetary Shielding
     System.  The PSS will provide a sturdy shield for your
     planet which your enemies will have a hard time
     penetrating with fighters or photon missiles.

<V>  Evict Other Traders.  Now that you've survived all the
     defenses your opponent placed to keep you out, you should
     be able to come in and take over, right?  Occasionally
     you go into a newly captured Citadel only to find the
     trader (or traders) who previously controlled the planet. 
     No need to have them in your way.  Simply select this
     option to activate the Emergency Warning System in the
     Citadel.  It will alert these unwanted guests to some
     impending doom and their ships will blast off into orbit
     around the planet.  The system will list the traders as
     they escape.  You then may either stay in the Citadel out
     of harm's way or you can go out into the sector to
     inflict more damage on your enemy.

CORPORATION MENU

<D>  Display Corporations.  If you want to see how you and
     your corporation compare with others in the game or if
     you want to see who the members are of a specific
     corporation, use this selection.  You will asked if you
     want to List Corporations or Rank Corporations.  L will
     give you a listing of all corporations registered at
     Federation Hall showing the corporation's registration
     number and the date of incorporation and all corporate
     members with the C.E.O. labeled.  R will display a list
     of all corporations ranked by experience.  The list shows
     the rank, the corporate registration number and name, the
     C.E.O.'s name, the corporate alignment and the corporate
     experience.

<J>  Join a Corporation.  When you want to join forces with a
     corporation of the other traders, you will need to make
     arrangements to get your corporate security pass.  When
     a member of that corporation has approved your
     membership, use this option to join.  You will need to be
     of the same alignment as the C.E.O.  If at any time
     during your tenure with the corporation, your alignment
     is opposite that of the Chairman, you will be
     automatically ousted from the Corporation.

<M>  Make a New Corporation.  When you are prepared to make to
     move from independent trader to Corporate C.E.O., this
     option will file your Corporate Charter in the
     Federation's Hall of Records.  As C.E.O. you will have
     privileges that other players don't have such as owning
     an Corporate Flagship and sending Corporate Memos to all
     members of your Corporation.  You will be the one to
     determine whether your Corporation is good or evil.  As
     you go, so goes the Corporation.  A prospective member
     will have to be of the same alignment as you to join.

<C>  Credit Transfer.  Use this option to transfer credits to
     or from your corporate associate.  You have to be in the
     same sector as the corporation member with whom you want
     to exchange credits.

<F>  Fighter Transfer.  Use this option to transfer fighters
     to or from your corporate associate.  You have to be in
     the same sector as the corporation member with whom you
     want to exchange fighters.

<H>  Mines Transfer.  Use this option to transfer mines to or
     from your corporate associate.  You have to be in the
     same sector as the corporation member with whom you want
     to exchange mines.

<S>  Shields Transfer.  Use this option to transfer shields to
     or from your corporate associate.  You have to be in the
     same sector as the corporation member with whom you want
     to exchange shields.

<X>  Leave Your Corporation.  There may come a time when you
     feel you have to make a break with your current
     corporation.  You may want to form your own new
     corporation.  You may want to play the game with an
     alignment different from that of your corporation's
     members.  This will allow you to vacate your position in
     your corporation.  Remember that you will no longer have
     access to any of the corporation's assets.  If you are
     the C.E.O. the corporation will be dissolved and all
     corporate fighters will become rogue mercenaries.

<L>  List Corporate Planets.  This will display a detailed
     graph of your corporation's planets.  The information
     includes 
     -the sector where the planet is located

     -the current population
     -the production rate for Fuel Ore, Organics and Equipment
     -the current inventories of the commodities

C.E.O.'s Only

<T>  Send Corporate Memo.  When you want to give information
     to all those in your organization, use this option. 
     Whether it is instructions on where you want to establish
     a new colony or a congratulatory dispatch for a job well
     done, you can send your message quickly and efficiently.

<P>  Corporate Security.  In a world where instances of
     computer crime run rampant, a C.E.O. can never be too
     careful.  Be sure you trust a player before you let him
     or her in your organization.  And just as with your BBS
     account, you can better maintain security if you change
     passwords occasionally.

<R>  Drop Corporate Member.  Do you have a problem with a
     member of your Corporation?  Is that member showing signs
     of insubordination?  You don't have to put up with the
     stress.  Simply drop this trouble maker.  Remember that
     the member can take any corporate assets on his/her ship
     when kicked out.

     than just a drink and a meal.  Some of the more
     interesting features of this game can be found here if
     you ask the right questions.

HARDWARE MENU

<A>  Atomic Detonators.  These detonators are used in the
     destruction of planets.  If you don't have enough
     military to take out a planet, you can set Atomic
     Detonators and run like hell.  Warning: colonists have
     been trained to disarm these detonators.  These units are
     as unstable as they are powerful.  They can react like
     Corbomite Devices when an enemy attacks your ship, and
     they can also detonate by hitting mines or offensive
     fighters as you journey through the galaxy.

<B>  Marker Beacons.  Marker Beacons are the billboards of the
     Trade Wars universe.  They are an inexpensive way to make
     a statement.  They stay in the sector where they are
     launched until they are destroyed.  They have absolutely
     no defensive capability.  They are so fragile that if two
     are launched in the same sector, they both explode.

<C>  Corbomite Devices.  Corbomite devices are weapons to
     avenge the destruction of your ship.  If one of your
     opponents succeeds in obliterating your craft, that
     person may suffer substantial damage as well when your
     ship is equipped with one or more of these.  Corbomite
     devices can also be viewed as protection.  Your enemies
     may think twice about attacking you if you are armed with
     these.  With each additional device you add to your
     vessel, you increase your protection level.  You can have
     up to a Level 1500 Corbomite Device on some ships and the
     nice part is, your foe has no way to detect the device's
     presence on your ship.

<D>  Cloaking Device.  Cloaking devices can hide you from your
     rivals when you are away from your home sector.  If you
     feel you will be vulnerable, use your Cloaking Device to
     conceal your ship.  Your location will be unknown to even
     your Corporate associates who view the Member Location
     display.  Remember that the Cloaking Device will use a
     lot of your energy reserves and its effectiveness
     decreases the longer it's used.  A well-known consumer
     group has tested these devices and found that on the
     average, after 72 hours of use, you stand a 50% chance of
     being detected.  Cloaking Devices are relatively
     inexpensive, but because some of the components decompose
     quickly, they are a one-time use item.

<E>  SubSpace Ether Probes.  Ethereal Probes are quite useful
     when you want to know what wonders lie on the other side
     of the universe, but you don't want to use up your turns
     to explore.  You can launch the unmanned probes with a
     preset destination.  As they maneuver their way across
     the cosmos, they report back sector by sector.  They are
     quite inexpensive for the amount of information that can
     be obtained, but they are not sturdy.  They contain a
     self-destruct mechanism that is triggered when the probe
     reaches its destination.  The designers of the probe
     thought this would provide anonymity for anyone using the
     gadget.  This mechanism is so sensitive that it detonates
     when the probe encounters any enemy fighters.  Since it
     has no shielding capabilities, any ship it passes will be
     able to detect its presence.

<F>  Planet Scanners.  If you are planning an invasion of
     another player's planet, this scanner can show you the
     military system on the planet without landing.  Once you
     are in the sector, scan the planet.  You can see who
     created the planet, who currently controls the planet,
     and the military defenses installed there.  You won't
     find out the hard way that you don't have enough weapons
     to take over the enemy forces.

<M>  Space Mines.  This weapon can be a very effective way of
     establishing your territory.  Space mines can cause
     serious damage to smaller craft and can be a real
     nuisance to larger vessels.  The latest technology has
     provided mines with sensors capable of recognizing the
     Federal I.D. codes.  This will keep the mines from
     detonating by your ship or your Corporation's ships (most
     of the time).

<P>  Photon Missiles.  Only owners of Missile Frigates or
     Imperial Starships can use these powerful weapons. 
     Shields, both Ship and Planetary, are excellent
     protection from the impact of this weapon.   However,
     once shields have been destroyed, Photon Missiles can be
     used to disable all Combat Control Computers (Level 2
     Citadels) and Quasar Cannons (Level 3 Citadels) on
     planets.  It neutralizes all mines and fighters stationed
     in a sector.  Be advised that the effect of these
     missiles is short-lived.  Get in, take care of your
     business and get out before the effect wears off.  You
     don't want to still be in the sector when the Quasar
     Cannons regain their strength.  Great care should be used
     in transporting these volatile weapons of destruction.  

<R>  Long Range Scanners.  These scanners can provide the
     explorer with multi-sector vision.  Your two options are
     a Density Scanner or a Holographic Scanner.  The Density
     Scanner is the cheaper and it provides the user with the
     relative density of the surrounding sectors.  You can use
     that information to determine what may be in the
     neighborhood.  If you have sufficient funds, you can
     purchase a Holographic Scanner which has both Density and
     Holographic capabilities.  Using the Holographic mode,
     you can see what and who is in the sectors adjacent to
     the one you are currently occupying.  The scanner in
     Holographic mode uses a small amount of your ship's fuel
     (one turn's worth) but that is a small price to pay when
     you consider the information and security it can provide.

<S>  Mine Disrupters.  If you run across a heavily mined
     sector but you really need to go in there, send in a Mine
     Sweeper to clear your path.  They can absorb the damage
     so you don't have to.

<T>  Genesis Torpedoes.  Much improved since the first models,
     these torpedoes can provide the foundation for the
     production of your trading commodities.  The planets
     generated from the torpedo's explosion will be able to
     support a large number of colonists.  The colonists can
     provide the labor needed to mine the Fuel Ore, grow the
     Organics and manufacture the Equipment and Fighters you
     will use in your trading company.

<W>  TransWarp Drives.  Only Imperial Starships, Corporate
     Flagships and Havoc Gunstars have hulls sturdy enough to
     withstand TransWarp flight.  These drives use a massive
     amount of Fuel Ore so make sure you have a source of Ore
     for your return trip, too.  The TransWarp Drive uses a
     homing device, so you should have at least one fighter in
     your destination sector.

<Y>  Psychic Probes.  Bartering at the ports is one of the
     main elements of this game.  You get experience points
     for making a good deal.  The better the deal, the more
     points you get.  Psychic Probes are the next best thing
     to insider trading, and they're legal.  If you want to
     see exactly where your offer is compared to what they
     would have accepted, you need one of these probes.  It
     will not only show you where you went wrong, but it will
     also help you improve your trading skills.

SHIPYARDS MENU

<B>  Buy a New Ship.  When you are ready to upgrade, or if you
     need a specialized ship, come to the Shipyards and talk
     to Cal Worthington XXI about a trade-in.  You will be
     offered a fair price for your current ship.  They will
     take anything in your trade such as fighters,
     accessories, mines, etc. so if you're trying to get a lot
     on your trade-in, load your ship up before you talk to
     them.  If you don't want to use all your extras in the
     trade, you might want to leave as much as you can in a
     secure place and pick it up after you purchase your new
     ship.  New ships are very basic models.  The extras are
     available at the Hardware Emporium and the Class 0 ports.

<E>  Examine Ship Specs.  This is the same information
     available to you from your ship's on-board computer, but
     in includes (for ANSI users only) a picture of each ship,
     both top and front view.  You may want to review the ship
     specifications one last time before you make your
     purchase.

<P>  Buy Class 0 Items.  After you purchase your ship, you may
     need to equip it with a few of the items normally
     purchased at the Class 0 ports.  You wouldn't want to
     take that brand new beauty out unprotected, would you? 
     The merchants in the shipyards have obtained fighters,
     shields and holds from "trade-ins" so they are offering
     them right here where you buy your ship as a convenience
     to you.  Be forewarned that you will be paying a premium
     price for this convenience.    

<R>  Change Ship Registration.  It's not paranoia when they're
     really out to get you.  If your foes are tracking you
     down by reading the logs at the StarPorts or they've
     received information on your ship from a loose-tongued
     fool at the tavern, go to this back room in the offices
     of the Shipyards.  For a hefty fee, you can get revised
     registration papers on your ship and christen it with a
     new, untraceable name.

TAVERN MENU

<A>  Make an Announcement.  Do you have something of interest
     for all the patrons of the tavern?  If so, pay the fee
     and post your announcement.  It will stay there until the
     next announcement is posted.

<B>  Buy Something from the Bar.  Had a trying day?  Want a
     little something to soothe your nerves?  Order up
     whatever your heart desires.  You might even get it in a
     clean glass.  Remember FedLaw says, don't drink and fly.

<C>  Eavesdrop on Conversations.  See that group of
     individuals gathered at the table in the darkest corner
     of the tavern?  They seem to be engaged in some very
     engrossing dialogue.  If you would care to listen in and
     maybe even add some remarks of your own, use this option.

<E>  Order Some Food.  You really need to keep your strength
     up so you can take on the challenges of the cosmos. 
     Order up the Blue Plate Special (the food is blue, not
     the plate) and nourish yourself with some of the most
     memorable edibles this side of Barlaam.

<G>  Try Your Hand at Tri-Cron.  Do you feel lucky, Punk?  Put
     your money down and see if you can beat the odds.  A
     simple game of chance might relax you and you never know,
     you might come away a big winner.  The game is easy - the
     detailed instructions are available in the Tavern.  The
     cost of playing is based on the size of the Top Winner's
     Jackpot.  You'll have 10 rounds against the house.  If
     you win, the payback is 2 to 1.  If you're the top
     winner, you receive the accumulated jackpot.

<T>  Talk to the Grimy Trader in Back.  Not much to look at,
     but he can be a wealth of information.  Depending on how
     many drinks he's had, his facts may be a bit suspect. 
     Just ask him about a specific topic, give him a little
     inducement and he'll tell you what he knows.  If you
     speak to him respectfully, he'll be fair to you. 
     Otherwise he might try to take advantage of your need for
     information.  You'll have to pay dearly for it, but he
     can sometimes get you information on specific Traders.

<U>  Use the Facilities.  When Mother Nature calls, this
     option will allow you to answer.  Feel free to read the
     graffiti to keep yourself entertained.  You can even add
     some of your own prose or poetry but beware of what may
     be lurking in the next stall.

FEDPOLICE HEADQUARTERS MENU

<A>  Apply for a Federal Commission.  The Federation awards
     commissions to those individuals who have shown
     themselves to be highly experienced and law abiding.  If
     you believe yourself to qualify, apply at the Police
     Headquarters.  If the Feds grant you a commission, you
     will be able to procure an Imperial Starship.  This is a
     very powerful ship but with it comes a lot of
     responsibility.  The Federation may call upon you to aid
     their cause of maintaining law and order throughout the
     universe.  There are a limited number of Starships
     available, so apply for your commission as soon as you
     can.

<C>  Claim a Federation Reward.  After you have done your duty
     as a good FedLaw abiding citizen, you will want to claim
     the reward that is rightfully yours.  March right into
     the Police HQ and tell the sergeant that he no longer has
     to worry about the scumbag you terminated.  Be sure to
     put the reward money to good use.

<E>  Examine the Ten Most Wanted List.  There is a listing
     available in the FedPolice building of the most corrupt
     players in the game.  This list shows the level of evil
     the player has achieved, the corporation to which he/she
     belongs, the number of bounties posted on that player and
     the total reward for that player's demise.

<P>  Post a Reward on Someone.  Would you like to make it a
     little more rewarding for someone to get one of the
     players on the Most Wanted list?  You can offer as small
     or as large a payment as you would like.  Just see the
     officer on duty and tell him you want to post a reward. 
     You will be shown the list of the Most Wanted criminals. 
     Tell the nice officer which one you would most like to
     see brought to justice and how much you want to give to
     help in the cause.

BANK MENU

<D>  Make a Deposit.  You can inform the TellBorg that you
     wish to deposit some or all of the credits you have with
     you.  The transaction is recorded instantly so you don't
     have to wait three days for your deposit to be reflected
     in your account.  

<E>  Examine Balance.  You might want to see if that other
     trader who promised you a reward for helping out with the
     Ferrengi has come through with the credits.  You might
     only want to check your funds to see if you can go on a
     spending spree at the Hardware Emporium.  This selection
     can put the answer at your fingertips.

<T>  Transfer Funds.  If you need to get funds to a Trader who
     is not in your corporation, this option will authorize
     you to make a deposit in that other Trader's account. 
     Naturally, you must have the credits to be able to
     transfer them.

<W>  Withdraw Funds.  Saving can really pay off.  If your ship
     has been destroyed and you don't want to start from
     scratch in a Scout, a nest egg in the Galactic Bank can
     allow you to come right back with the ship of your
     choice.  Use this option to take your savings and spend
     them any way you choose.  You and only you have the
     authorization to withdraw credits from your account.
