      BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
 
                         A PROCLAMATION
 
The Allied armies, through sacrifice and devotion and with God's help, have
wrung from Germany a final and unconditional surrender.  The western world has
been freed of the evil forces which for five years and longer have imprisoned
the bodies and broken the lives of millions upon millions of free-born men.

They have violated their churches, destroyed their homes, corrupted their
children, and murdered their loved ones.  Our Armies of Liberation have restored
freedom to these suffering peoples, whose spirit and will the oppressors could
never enslave.
 
Much remains to be done.  The victory won in the West must now be won in the
East.  The whole world must be cleansed of the evil from which half the world
has been freed.  United, the peace-loving nations have demonstrated in the West
that their arms are stronger by far than the might of dictators or the tyranny
of military cliques that once called us soft and weak.  The power of our peoples
to defend themselves against all enemies will be proved in the Pacific was as it
has been proved in Europe.
 
For the trimuph of spirit and of arms which we have won, and of its promise to
peoples everywhere who join us in the love of freedom, it is fitting that we, as
a nation, give thanks to Almighty God, who has strengthened us and given us the
victory.
 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the United States of America,
do hereby appoint Sunday, May 13, 1945 to be a day of prayer.
 
I call upon the people of the United States, whatever their faith, to unite in
offering joyful thanks to God for the victory we have won and to pray that He
will support us to the end of our present struggle and guide us into the way of
peace.
 
I also call upon my countrymen to dedicate this day of prayer to the memory of
those who have given their lives to make possible our victory.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the
United States of America to be affixed.
 
      Done at the City of Washington this eighth day of May in
    ..   the year of our Lord
