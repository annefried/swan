Paul Stahl's photos he sent me.  Thanks again to Paul for sending them
to me.  Please note that there are a few typos/spelling errors in this

                                A-12

The A-12 was the proof-of-concept vehicle for the SR-71/YF-12 family
of "Blackbirds."  It was the 12th in a series of designs for a U-2
replacement from Kelly Johnson's "Skunk Works," hence the designation
"A-12."  Although its operational service is shrouded in mystery, it
is believed the single-seat A-12 was used exclusively in covert
operations by the CIA from 1967 to 1968.

                           **************

Of the fifteen A-12's produced, this is the prototype aircraft,
#60-6924....the first one built and flown.  Although momentarily
lifting off during a high-speed taxi check on Apr 24, 1962, it's
first real flight was two days later, from the Air Force's classi-
fied Groom Lake flight test facility in Nevada.  Restoration
