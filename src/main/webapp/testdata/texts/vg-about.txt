ABOUT THE VIDEO GAME RATINGS REPORT

In this report, video games have been rated on a scale of 1 to 10,
with 10 being the best and 1 being the worst.  For each video game,
the total number of votes, the average rating, and the vote
distribution are shown.  New video games are indicated by an `*'
before their entry.

The vote distribution uses a single character to represent the
percentage of votes for each ranking.  The following characters codes
can appear:
     
`.' no votes cast        `3' 30-39% of the votes  `7' 70-79% of the votes
`0'  1-9%  of the votes  `4' 40-49% of the votes  `8' 80-89% of the votes
`1' 10-19% of the votes  `5' 50-59% of the votes  `9' 90-99% of the votes
`2' 20-29% of the votes  `6' 60-69% of the votes  `*' 100%   of the votes

To have your votes tallied in the list, send mail to the video game
ratings server (the address is given below).  In your letter, any line
beginning with the word `vote' will be considered a vote.  All other
lines are ignored.  Votes must be of the form:

	vote rating system-code video-game-title

where `rating' is an integer between 1 and 10, `system-code' is a
two-letter code describing the system, and `video-game-title' is
everything else on the line after `system-code'.  Valid system codes
include:

   Al	Atari Lynx
   Gb	Nintendo Game Boy
   Gg	Sega Game Gear
   Ne	Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) or Famicom
   Ng	SNK Neo Geo
   Sn	Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) or Super Famicom
   Sg	Sega Genesis or Mega Drive
   Tg	NEC Turbografx-16, Turboexpress, or PC-Engine

Case is not considered in video game titles or system codes.  Valid votes
might be

	vote 10 Sg John Madden Football '92
	vote 10 sn super mario world

NO HUMAN WILL EVER SEE YOUR BALLOTS, AND YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE AN
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF YOUR VOTES.  ALSO, THE VIDEO GAME RATINGS SERVER
WILL SILENTLY IGNORE ALL INVALID VOTES.

The source code for this system and much of this text for this ratings
report was provided by Chuck Musciano.  John Leo originally adapted
this system for video games, and Eric Ng (the current video game
ratings report administrator) has since made many more modifications.

Thanks for participating in the rec.games.video ratings poll.
